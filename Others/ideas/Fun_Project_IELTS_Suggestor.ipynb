Some argue that parents are the primary influencers in a child's life and therefore should be the ones to instill values and morals in them. On the other hand, some believe that schools are better equipped to teach children about societal norms and values as they have a structured curriculum in place for this purpose.\n> \n> Those who believe that parents should take on this responsibility argue that parents have a more intimate relationship with their children and can therefore tailor their teachings to suit their child's individual needs. Parents are also seen as the first role models that children look up to and learn from. By teaching children how to be good members of society, parents can instill important values such as empathy, respect, and responsibility early on.\n> \n> On the other hand, proponents of the view that schools are the best place to learn how to be good members of society argue that schools have a diverse environment that exposes children to different cultures, beliefs, and perspectives. Schools also have a structured curriculum that includes subjects like social studies and moral education, which aim to teach children about societal values and norms.\n> \n> In my opinion, both parents and schools play crucial roles in shaping a child's character and teaching them how to be good members of society. While parents are the first teachers and influencers in a child's life, schools also have an important role to play in reinforcing these values and providing a broader perspective on societal norms. Ultimately, a combination of teachings from both parents and schools is necessary to raise well-rounded individuals who contribute positively to society."
