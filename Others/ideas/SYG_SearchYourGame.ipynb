About the Game\\nThe game’s storyline is a 13th-century Japanese epic, with beautiful, detailed scenery including animals (songbirds including golden ones which lead you not-so-subtly when you get lost or distracted, crickets, and foxes which you can pet) torii gates, and Shinto temples.  \\nYou are samurai lord Jin Sakai, and you are tasked with repelling the so-far-successful Mongol invaders (under Khotun Khan, who is the grandson of the acclaimed Genghis) to reclaim your land and avenge the insult to your home which has been invaded and taken over. \\nHowever, in order to succeed, you have to make some hard decisions: adhere to the strict honourable protocols of samurai, or do the ‘right’ thing morally? As you morph from Jin, the upright samurai, into ‘The Ghost,’ you will gather a motley crew of allies about you, and as you travel, you will uncover their back stories and help them resolve their issues.  \\nYour allies include Sensei Ishikawa, the renowned samurai archer searching for his missing student; Masako, a grief-stricken mother out for revenge on those who murdered her family; and Yuna, the thief who saved your life at the very beginning of the story, and will do whatever it takes to save her brother from the Mongols.  The Nitty Gritty\\nAs you play along the story arc, side quests and NPCs (non-playing characters) give you some guidance in your meandering, inviting you to detour and enjoy even more of the wonderfully rendered scenery. There are even moments of restful tranquillity when you can just sit and enjoy nature. \\nFor the less peaceful moments, you have a katana for self-defence (and attack) amongst other weapons. (More about the weapons below.) You will choose to play as one of the four available classes and you can play single player mode (which is actually for one or two players) or co-op mode (which is for two or four players) or you can try your hand at the multiplayer version. \\nYou can play in English or Japanese with optional English subtitles – however, lip-readers will quickly note that the mouth movements are for English, regardless of your language choice. You can also opt for Kurosawa mode to evoke the black and white classics of classic film-maker Akira Kurosawa, who gave the world its abiding image of Japanese samurai with his films about that chivalric world. \\nSide quests are known as Tales: there are standard real-life (ish) based tales and also Mystic Tales which explore the more supernatural side of things. Combat is, as you might expect, mostly katana based, and you can take out an enemy with a few skilful strokes. But, you can be taken out the same way, so you must learn to block, parry and dodge as well as swing your sword about madly. High scores enhance your experience, making precise play worthwhile. \\nThere is no map game on the screen, in fact there are no indicators in the open world at all. While this makes it an immersive gaming experience, it can also be frustrating: until you realise that the game is packed with hints and reminders: the wind subtly blows in the direction of recommended travel. Occasionally things like plumes of smoke, bird flights, swirls of leaves, etc, will give you a slightly more urgent call to move.  \\nYou will travel by horseback in the main, and can use grappling hooks when it is necessary for you to climb up or access something out of your easy reach.   What Weapons?\\nAs you progress you unlock ever more impressive armour, costumes, charms, many of which can be upgraded. These benefits include reduced damage, reduced enemy awareness – it takes longer for them to notice you, improved health, faster healing, or boosted melee damage. The only exceptions are head and face customisations which are purely cosmetic.  Katana: your traditional samurai sword, which buffs as you find power-ups and boosters, giving you, literally, the edge in battles Bows: bows and arrows were the go-to weapons of the time, but these have additional extra. Different types of bows have different effects on the enemy, so have fun trying them out and take care stocking up your quiver Stealth: while not traditionally thought of as a weapon, players will quickly realise that this stealth is less designed to help you creep past your enemies, but is more to allow you to get into a great position from which to ambush your enemies Firecrackers: if your stealthy tactics aren’t quite working, lob a couple of firecrackers to distract or decoy them while you sneak up on them and add to your body count Smoke bombs: like firecrackers, but long-lasting, smoke bombs can help you set a set or, if you don’t feel like a battle at the moment, to sneak past an enemy encampment Kunai: these fierce looking stabby darts were originally thought to be masons’ tools, adapted for self-defence. Now, and in this game, they are ideal daggers, throwing knives and generally sharp spikes which help you in taking down multiple enemies at once \\nGhost of Tsushima for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9093/pcover/9093.jpg?v=1710856562\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 2}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=\": 3\\nname: Ready or Not\\ndescription: Los Sueños – The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home.  \\nIt has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.”  \\nIn response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city.  \\n“This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.”  \\nThe Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team:  \\nNew Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals.  \\nTake Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality.  \\nSWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape.  \\nEquipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/2075/pcover/2075.jpg?v=1703176792\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 3}),\n",

Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?SYNOPSIS\\nSet in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP\\nYou’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.\\nCoop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.\\nWhatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out. \\nUltimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. \\nTrials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.HIDE OR FLIGHT\\nIn pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.\\nThe tools will allow you to  Stun enemiesBlind themSee through wallsHeal yourself and people around you.Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION\\nCustomize and create your own trial patient.\\nYour cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish.\\nChoose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. \\nMeet the Denizens of Murkoff’s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?   INVESTIGATE\\nYou’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. \\nCollect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.\\nThe Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning:The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.\\nThis game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

              " Document(page_content=': 6\\nname: Tekken 8\\ndescription: Tekken 8 for PC is just the latest in a long line of Tekken games: it is the eighth main game, and tenth release overall. But it is only the second game to be made available on PC: the first being Tekken 7. Tekken (the word comes from the Japanese Tetsu no ken, meaning ‘Iron Fist,’) is a fighting game, and in this game, the developers have perfected their understanding of what their players want from the game.     About the Game\\nTekken 8 maintains the die-hard fans’ favourite moves and gameplay, while adapting and innovating to make those best bits even better. The devs have also smoothed out any glitches or hiccups that might have detracted from the action in other iterations of the game.  \\nThe upcoming showdown between Jin Kazama and Kazuya Mishima is front and centre in this game, just as the fight between Kazuya and Heihachi Mishima was in Tekken 7. While that fight resolved itself into a win for Kazuya – but don’t count Heihachi out until you’ve checked his pulse! – the stakes are just as high the showdown between the last two members of the Mishima bloodline (and the last two carriers of the Devil Gene) (more about which, see below) \\nSo, Jin wants to kill his dad and put an end to the whole thing. Kazuya, fresh off of his win against Heihachi, is destroying cities and encouraging humanity to get to war. In the game’s continuity, this game takes place six months after the abovementioned battle, but the conflict between Kazuya and Jin is a little different than the one between Heihachi and Kazuya.\\nWhile the two of them were ultimately motivated by power and revenge, and each viewed the other as the biggest obstacle in his path, Jin’s ultimate struggle is more against the bloodline he inherited from his father and the Devil Gene itself.     The Nitty Gritty\\nGameplaywise, rage system attacks return from the previous game, but have now been refined and expanded to include a Heat System of which Heat Smash is the pinnacle. Your heat bar fills as you play, turning purple when it’s ready to be deployed. It lasts 10 seconds once activated and you can perform Heat Dashes and that Heat Smash, amongst other things. \\nEach player responds differently to their own Heat bar activation: some enjoy healing faster, others boost aggression levels, or get more power or accuracy etc. Unlike other games, landing aggressive attacks on your enemy maintains the level of your Heat bar, rather than using it up. Tying into the ‘rewards for aggression’ system, your character’s health is restored by attacking enemies. \\nThis relatively major tweak, one that will greatly benefit some players, introduces rewards for using aggression – players who embrace rage and actively attack will earn more points and XP than those who try to use stealth and pacificism to navigate around the game. Each attack creates chip damage in your enemies, which can be gathered to boost your health further.    \\nThe online mode, called Arcade Quest, offers a broad swathe of contests, gameplay and customisation (tournaments, one on ones, making outfits for your favourite fighters and more), and is a great way to get to know the game – and it should be more stable and user friendlier than ever before thanks to the new rollback netcode which enhances synchronicity and will ensure that your gameplay is not disrupted by an inconvenient lag at the wrong time.\\nPlayers will have access to five new stages: Arena, Rebel Hangar, Sanctum, Urban Square, and Yakushima during the course of the game. All of these stages have wonderfully rendered, highly detailed backgrounds with lots of fun elements and awesome environment transitions. \\nThe game has the series’ usual high focus on hand-to-hand combat, but now there is also a staginess to the gameplay – a level of performativity – which was birthed by the positive reactions of fans to streamed gameplay. Greater destructiveness and stagey gameplay earned more kudos and positive comment on streams than safer or tamer ‘footage’, so that has been considered too, with the game now lending itself well to streaming. \\nThere are at least 32 characters included in the game, including some new characters like Jack-8, the protagonist taking over from Jack-7, and Azucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (a happy-go-lucky Peruvian mixed-martial-artist and daughter of a coffee company owner.) The returning characters are very recognisable for players who have their favourites, but all of them have enjoyed upgrades and improvements to boost gameplay and satisfaction. \\nThe game is completely cross-platform so players can join their friends on consoles for showdowns and tournaments. The game uses Unreal Engine 5 for smooth gameplay and seamless action.     Mashima Family Tree (Possessors of the Devil Gene)\\nThe following member of the Mashima bloodline have the powerful – and aggressive – Devil Gene, a supernatural genetic inheritance:  Jin Kazama: the protagonist of the game since Tekken 3, you will play as Jin. Devil Jin: traditionally a separate character to Jin, this guy is Jin’s alter ego, the version of the character that shows up when the Devil Gene is activated Kazuya Mishima: Jin’s father and the protagonist of the first two games, thenceforward becoming the antagonist. Heihachi Mashima: Jin’s grandfather and Kazuya’s father. He is almost always the antagonist (although he was the protagonist in Tekken 2 – but he is always responsible for the events that precipitate the game’s events – all the games, including this one! Jun Kazama: Jin’s mom makes a return to the series, coming to PC for the first time, as she was last seen in Tekken 2. She has an affinity with animals and observes them to improve her fighting skills. And, despite the game’s favouring of aggression, Jun has great defensive capabilities and can neutralise attacks. \\nTekken 8 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=\": 7\\nname: Cities: Skylines II\\ndescription: Cities: Skylines II for PC is a city building game, the sequel to the first game with the same name. The player is the developer of a plot of land on which they must create a city. Players can lay down roads, zoning, utilities, and city services to attract residents and businesses. You can also set city policies like taxes and edicts to influence how the city grows – and spend the tax money on more expansion, better services and improved infrastructure.   About the Game\\nInitially you are limited to nine tiles of building space but you can purchase additional tiles from city funds – the above-mentioned tax, amongst other earning. Nine tiles was the upper limit of the previous game (it was twenty-five in the remastered edition that was for consoles): this game allows the player ultimately to go up to a hefty 441 tiles. \\nThis means that the new map for Cities Skylines 2 tops out at 159km2 which is the same size as the entire country of Liechtenstein, in Europe. Buildings can be taller than before, so even within that nine tile starting point, you can do more.  \\nYou must create trade routes to feed your city and keep your residents happy – this is even more important than before as population controls – previously set to around 65,000 people – have been done away with. Each map in the game has a preset climate that influences the way weather patterns form. The weather and the population are all set in day-night and annual cycles, so people’s productivity will increase and decrease with the time of year. \\nThe cold winters bring snow and ice, with grey skies, while summer means flooding and extreme events like tornadoes. You must set up disaster response facilities and services within the city to cope with these annual events. \\nThese services will be ranged alongside regular policing and fire departments, which have also been improved. You can now assign these services to set areas so their response times are quick and efficient.\\nYou will also set up public services like education, safety boards and so on, right down to sanitation services. Unlike the first game, in this version, you will also worry about the welfare of your population, communication systems and even mortuary services – and all of these can be expanded and upgraded once they are in place. \\nThe game acknowledges the existence of other cities outside the game, and that means that you can arrange imports and exports. This is managed through a technology tree which is unlocked through play. Do note that weather affects your import and export network, just as it does your in-game public transport network.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game has vastly improved and expanded upon the city building system that fans enjoyed, while adding more to the transport and economic systems, boosted construction methods and now allows for much more precise customisation – and even some advanced modding capabilities too. See below for some of the improvements in detail.  What’s New and Improved?\\nThese are just some of the new and improved features of the game – see how many others you can unlock:  You have more fine-tuning control on the zoning of your city, able to designate residential, commercial, and industrial zones, and even more niche ones such as mixed-used residential. Signature buildings can be unlocked through specific milestones and placed within zones to improve the desirability of the area and the quality of life of your populace in the area. The first game relied purely on distance to plot routes for the population: this has been tweaked to use traffic levels, toll costs, comfort and even personal preferences. There's a complex AI pathfinding system that will give more realism to how citizens navigate your city. Along with realistic daily weather events, you can expect to experience tornados, forest fires, and hailstorms in random events – hopefully not all at the same time. In the reformed road usage all vehicles will now use all lanes, preventing needless traffic but introducing levels of danger when navigating the roads. And, like in life, delivery trucks and citizens will play it safe, while emergency vehicles are more likely to speed or do dangerous U-turns in traffic. You can treat the game like a human simulation game this time, following members of your population from start to finish – birth to death – and generally being as nosy as you like. You’ll even be awarded a Little Stalker achievement if you do thoroughly enough! Your population can suffer from homelessness, an entirely new feature. To prevent this, you must ensure that their income stays ahead of their outgoings otherwise they might end up living in the city parks. \\nCities: Skylines II for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Despite the renaming, the company said in its statement that the rebranded franchise would retain its licenses of more than 19,000 players, over 700 teams, over 100 stadiums, and over 30 leagues – all based on real people and teams.   About the Game\\nAnyone who played a FIFA game for any decent length of time knew that the menus were annoying. They were slow to load, awkward to navigate, and quite boring to look at. Under the umbrellas of the change to EA Sports, the games developers have used the switch as an opportunity to significantly overhaul the menus and they are now much improved: easier to use, almost intuitive, and logically laid out.\\nAs well as access to the above-mentioned 30 different leagues, (which includes the Premier League, the Europa League and the Women’s Super League) EA has added two further women’s leagues – namely, the Google Pixel Frauen-Bundesliga and Liga F.  \\nThere’s a huge focus on realism in FC 24. EA has added in something called playstyles, which makes gameplay look even more realistic. As always, motion capture techniques along with real-world player data from various sources, the newly minted playstyles (more about which below) will give players unique capabilities that make their way of playing look and feel more authentic. \\nAnother improvement is found in HyperMotion, now upgraded to HyperMotion V (with the v standing for volumetric data which used footage captured by cameras around stadiums from over 180 top tier matches to recreate authentic players), which continues to develop the fluidity and rhythm of how players move on the pitch. The advanced Frostbite Engine, helps play look even more realistic, enabling you to see the ripple in players’ shirts as they move.   The Nitty Gritty\\nAs always, each new game relies on bringing even more real clubs into the fold and this game is no different. New licenses include Spain's Liga F, the Frauen-Bundesliga from Germany, and South Korea's men's second division K League 2. \\nReturning the data capture systems, the game benefits from over 11,000 in- game animations – compared to just 6,000 in the previous game, the last to bear FIFA’s name. Player movement has also been thoroughly assessed and divided into seven different archetypes: from controlled to explosive with graduations – the middle ground is ‘Controlled Explosive’ in which the player has half controlled characteristics, and half explosive. (See below).\\nNew to this game are PlayStyles which fall into six categories: scoring, passing, ball control, defending, physical, and goalkeeper. With all the various options, there are as many as 34 brand new PlayStyles so you can tailor your preferred players very precisely. \\nUltimate Team returns, and now allows gamers to improve their eligible players' skills, their PlayStyles, and their overall ratings. They can also level up their Player Item designs and backgrounds. In a nice move that, Ultimate teams can now hold both male and female players for a truly magical fantasy team.\\nThe roster has some new faces and ratings, with Alexia Putellas, Kevin de Bruyne, Erling Haaland, and Kylian Mbappe all sharing the highest rating of 91. This game is the first to include the French Ballon d’Or – and despite all the changes, it is still the game that fans know and love!   All About New Acceleration Types\\nThere are three base Acceleration Types: namely, Controlled, Explosive, and Lengthy. Most players are Controlled, but now you can add other elements to arrive at a nicely diverse cast of players. Explosive players tend to be shorter and more agile than other players, resulting in a greater initial burst of acceleration after which they slow down. Taller and stronger players are classified as Lengthy, having both height and stamina. This game introduces four new types to choose from:  Controlled Explosive: 50% Controlled, 50% Explosive Mostly Explosive: 70% Explosive, 30% Controlled Controlled Lengthy: 50% Controlled, 50% Lengthy Mostly Lengthy: 70% Lengthy, 30% Controlled \\nEA Sports FC 24 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 22\\nname: RoboCop: Rogue City\\ndescription: RoboCop: Rogue City for PC is a first-person shooter game that slots in between the events of the films RoboCop 2 and Robocop 3. Anne Lewis returns as RoboCop’s partner and is always with you as you play, making a useful sidekick.     About the Game\\nA new criminal has popped up to threaten the peace of the city, and not only are the press excited about him – calling him The New Guy in Town – but so are all the existing gangs. RoboCop is called upon to restore the peace in a tower block raid, with plenty of gunfights, lots of pop-up villains and even some hostage situations to resolve.\\nOf course, the main attraction is your playing character, the part-man, part-machine (one hundred percent law enforcer!) who goes forth armed with his Auto-9 and steel-clad protection which makes enemy bullets bounce off futilely.  \\nThe action goes where the news is, with the introduction of the main big bad interrupted by a gang of thugs, who burst in, take hostages and wait for the police – namely RoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis – to come along and sort things out.\\nRoboCop’s heavy build means that his progress is slow – practically tank-like. But this isn’t a problem. Villains can rush up to RoboCop, but they can’t do much to him, so it’s often fun to just keep on coming until they turn tail and flee – or, as they say, feel your wrath! As well as whaling on bad guys and gang members, you also have to investigate crimes, poke around crime scenes to find clues and make arrests of likely looking felons.   \\nRoboCop is big and strong enough to always choose violence if he wants – even running out of ammunition is no real obstacle to him. Should he start running low, he can just march (slowly) up to the next bad guy in line and punch him into next Tuesday! However, he does not always have to use force: some of the side quests offer more conciliatory paths to success, using persuasion and dialogue to encourage a gang member to provide needed information.\\nYou can also earn goodwill by doing favours for fellow police officers, or by interacting with the citizens of the city. And this non-violent path is actively encouraged to assist with your investigations: you can upgrade your dialogue choices using a skill tree to get more out of your peaceful exchanges with citizens, good or bad alike.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game is quite strongly choice-based, with different results depending on your choices in solving puzzles and side quests. These effects go all the way to the finish line, with different end scenes appearing depending on the choices you have made. How must trust the citizens have for RoboCop by the end also has an impact on how the end plays out.\\nRoboCop’s Auto-9 has unlimited ammo, but other weapons can be collected and their use is quite limited. Villains will try all sorts to slow RoboCop down, from chucking explosive barrels and TVs as well as shooting at him – but he is so sturdy that these have little effect on him. If he does suffer ill-effects, health will regenerate in time, and RoboCop can use enemies as human shields should he need to.   \\nBe aware that the background of Detroit is not just for show. While the grimy streets and decrepit buildings are there to show the state of affairs, you should pay attention to the thugs and wannabe hard men lurking on street corners and near lampposts – eavesdropping on snippets of their conversations can be useful to some of your investigations and side quests…  RoboCop’s Powers\\nAs well as being almost invincible in his armour, RoboCop has a number of other powers, most of which can be upgraded in time as you play and grow. But all are useful and should be mastered as quickly as possible. Let’s have a look at them:  Night Vision: Being able to see in the dark means that RoboCop can always see who’s coming for him, even when it’s dark all around Flashbang Shockwave: When a horde of enemies is rushing at you, even RoboCop needs a moment to sort out his response. Keep the enemies at bay with this shockwave flashbang that will tumble them off their feet and give you a precious few moments to react Slow Time: In certain circumstances, RoboCop can effectively slow down time so that he can pick off a room full of villains before they know what’s hit them. A highly useful skill to deploy at the right moment Scanner: Activating his scanner allows RoboCop to focus on villains and pick up legal violations – even parking tickets – so that he can forestall disorderly behaviour and keep an eye on those who need it the most Speed Walk: While RoboCop is never a speedy lad, his measured plodding tread can be sped up to a brisk walk, which is more than enough to send a bushel of bad guys running out of the back door – if they can find it in time before the metallic behemoth is upon them \\nAll of these useful skills and weapons can be upgraded through skill trees so you stay ahead of the enemies. \\nRoboCop: Rogue City for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 24\\nname: Nightingale\\ndescription: Nightingale for PC is a shared world survival crafting game set in an alternative Victorian world. Sort of Minecraft gone fantasy shared world survival, if you like. Your character is stranded beyond our world, cut off by the sudden collapse of the arcane portal network and must learn to navigate in this new and rather dangerous world…     About the Game\\nThe game begins, as most survival games do, with you in a pretty basic set-up – the bare minimum is given to you. Some sticks, the ability to make fire, and a list of items to forage and quest for to get you to the next, slightly more comfortable level of shelter/ food/ clothing etc. However, unlike most survival games, the emphasis is not on the endless grind, and it isn’t long before you are well-dressed and living in a comfortable home.\\nBut you’re not content with that – there is always more to improve upon or upgrade or get more of. From the bare basics of survival, it doesn’t take long for us to add comfort, beauty and opulence – even fun! – to our list of ‘must-haves’ and this game knowingly exploits that trait to very good effect.   \\nThere is a storyline that you are playing along, but the journey is ninety percent of the fun, so don’t rush to complete quests and stages – take your time, explore and try out all your new gizmos and gadgets as you go! There are many realms which you will be able to access, some are pivotal to the main storyline, but others are just for fun – enjoy all of them! \\nThe game is all about survival, however, so even when you are richly dressed and wealthy, you must make sure you take the time to eat well, rest properly, heal from harms and even dress appropriately for the weather (which is very changeable within the game!) – pretty much like in real life!   \\nNightingale is a city in an alternate version of Victorian times, and you are a realm-walker, able to cross to different realms through portals. This is possible due to the relationship between humans and the magical Fae folk. Humans have achieved great things with the help of magic – but they would have achieved these same things without help, so the relationship is something of a touchy one!\\nNightingale is the centre of magical studies and is the place from which the Realmwalkers arose – these being human adventurers who could use and control Fae portals to other realms. However, in 1889, some terrible miasma has arisen, the Pale, which has catastrophically disrupted the Portals, leaving people stranded in realms they were just visiting or – worse – merely passing through.   \\nSurvivors must learn to become Realmwalkers if they want to ever return to their homes… But the battle to do this is laid against the Fae Winter and Summer Courts, competing factions who aren’t really bothered – either way – about the petty worries and attempts of humans – something like an early human trying to tiptoe around a cataclysmic battle between a sabre-toothed tiger and a giant sloth without getting squished in between them! \\nThere are plenty of creatures and animals who do take a great interest in you though. From friendly giants to hungry wolf packs to mythical monsters and so much more, you will have plenty to keep you occupied – and then you will run up against the Bound with whom there is no peace, no trading and no deals…   \\nOne thing you will have to do fairly early on is choose a home realm, which is where you will spend a fair amount of time building and upgrading, and making yourself a home – although you will build other bases as you travel further afield. Your home realm is where you will return to when you are killed in game.\\nOne other major change from other survival games is the existence of NPCs who offer help, guidance and useful rewards like ingredients, schematics and more – you are not alone and forced into fending for yourself, which can make basic survival a lot more fun.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe devs are careful to refute any ‘steam-punk’ descriptors, but the graphics are wonderfully steampunk-adjacent, as well as being gothic and Victorian, with more than a strong hint of Lovecraft. The worlds are gorgeous and well worth exploring, especially with your magical Mary Poppinsesque flying umbrella.\\nCombat, when it occurs, is fast and intense, but do be careful as your ammo is tightly limited and many of the bigger enemies must be hit quite precisely, in weak points, rather than just blasted into oblivion with a stream of poorly aimed bullets. \\nOne main function you will do is to collect realm cards to open up and equip new realms (see more about these procedurally generated worlds below). Also, learn to get along with other characters in the game: co-operation between players is still the best way to craft, farm, build, and survive, but that decision is entirely up to you – you can, if you want to, shoot everything on sight!   \\nLook out for a number of real-life Victorian heroes, such as the world’s first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace (who was, coincidentally Lord Byron’s daughter) who lives out a much more satisfying existence than her real life, which was cut short by tuberculosis (consumption as it was known in those days) – she is a lead scientist in Nightingale.\\nFictional characters find a home here too: Alan Quartermain, hero of books like King Solomon’s Mines and She is the head of the Explorer’s Guild, a most appropriate appointment for him! Henry Hyde, who has touches of Dr Jekyll appear from time to time is in the game, as are a number of favourite literary and historical characters, so keep your eyes open for them!\\nThe end goal is to connect every single realm once again, and you can play with or without your friends: the entire universe is at your fingertips. To get to other realms, however, you’ll need both technology and cards. You can play with up to six players per realm and the more players you have, the easier you will find some challenges, so be sure to bring more friends along when you tackle bigger challenges!\\nThere is full character customisation so you can play as any gender, ethnicity, aesthetic that you like – you are only limited by your imagination!    More About Realm Cards\\nAs you progress through the game, you’ll eventually find realm cards. These are your key to other realms, and in each is a small chance to control where your next realm portal will take you.   Sneak Peek! Before you use the card, you can peep through a small window to see the potential realm on the other side. You can check out the atmosphere, animal life and a whole lot more before you commit to traveling there Environment: Realm cards allow you to set the environment of the realm you’re heading into Weather: Play weather god and set the perfect weather for your needs! Creatures: Make the animals cute and small and friendly, or opt for huge, powerful beasts of burden! See what creatures you can make by experimenting gently Resources: If you are running low on crafting supplies, you can boost the realm’s supply so you can top off your inventory to keep you going a bit longer\\nThese realm cards are fantastic as they offer so much choice to the player, because they can be combined, if desired, to create an even greater challenge. \\nNightingale for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/10138/pcover/10138.jpg?v=1708505550', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 24}),\n",

Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.   \\nA thaumaturge bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for Wiktor Szulski, the game’s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktor’s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as salutors - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons.  Features:Shape your story – as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. Develop your character – creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. Experience unique turn-based combat and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.Influence and manipulate the temperaments of other characters to bend their will to your liking. Tame the power of salutors – use the unique set of their skills to gain an advantage while exploring the world and when bringing your adversaries to their knees. See the world that’s inevitably gone – explore the uncommon, heavily researched historic period of the early XX century Warsaw, where crime and luxury are often two sides of the same coin. Meet historical figures and learn about their involvement in the story.

Sitting in a remote forested valley, the dilapidated homestead will test all your abilities as you attempt to turn it into the most prosperous ranch in the region – either alone or in up to four player co-op multiplayer.  Rebuild Your Ranch\\nThe years have not been kind to your family ranch and it will take time and money to restore it to its former glory. Buy tools from the local hardware store and purchase a range of vehicles from the garage to help with your rebuilding projects. Renovate the main house, decide what livestock you want to farm and construct the barns, pens and runs you’ll need to keep them safe and secure.  Look After Your Livestock\\nGrand building projects are one thing. Paying for them? That’ll come down to your ranching skills. Overseeing a profitable operation is all about the day-to-day. Once you’ve selected and taken on your livestock, regular feeding and watering will keep them healthy. Successful breeding and careful rearing of the young will help boost the numbers in your herds and flocks — and the more produce you have to sell, the more income you’ll receive for all that hard work. \\nExpand your ranch enterprise by farming crops, producing sausages and cheese and even training and selling horses.  Head Out on the Hunt\\nThere’s a large open-world environment outside your cosy homestead and it’s teeming with wildlife. So when you feel like slowing the pace, why not grab your trusty rifle and head out into the forest to stalk deer and hunt bears? But remember, the wilderness lives by its own laws and you aren’t the only skilled hunter in the neighbourhood. Sometimes your steady hand and sharp eyes will also be needed back on the ranch to stop hungry wolves turning your off-grid dream into a nightmare. \\nPlay the game PCGamesN calls \"House Flipper meets Red Dead Redemption 2\"!\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/8133/pcover/8133.jpg?v=1706094890', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 34}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 38\\nname: Winter Survival\\ndescription: What was supposed to be a nice winter hike in the Mount Washington State Park with friends, turned into a dire situation. You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, thirst, hunger, wildlife and your own state of mind while finding your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help.  \\nWinter Survival is a fully fledged survival game even going into Early Access, with dynamic combat, stealth, base building and its unique sanity system just to name a few. Multiple game modes and difficulties allow you to experience the game differently and tailor it to your taste.   \\nVenture through snow-covered forests, mountains, and frozen lakes. Grapple with treacherous terrain, deadly animals, and harsh winter conditions. Find shelter, cook meals, and rest, ready to face the next day. Hope it won’t be your last… \\nYou are not the first person to visit this area. There have been many before you. More than a century ago some even lived here. If you explore your surroundings you may find things they left behind that will still be useful to you. Explore various areas and discover their story, like a town built by people who are long gone. Force open doors, avoid traps, and make abandoned structures work again. Find personal belongings as you dive deeper into the town’s past. Will you be able to uncover its secrets?    Cold, thirst, hunger and physical as well as mental exhaustion are the five major factors you have to worry about. It doesn’t however end there. Injuries and sickness are other factors and then there is the weather. Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isn’t any better either. Don’t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable.  \\nFurther variety comes in with our event system where random events can save your day unexpectedly or make the nightmare even worse. Things do not have to be that bleak or stay that way all the time. The adaptation system allows you to open up new survival skills and strengthen your abilities. And then there is our unique sanity system to make things really interesting…   \\nThe most deviant enemy in a desolate land, is one’s mind. In Winter Survival you will experience an unforgiving world where it’s hard to distinguish reality from madness, due to the unique sanity system.  \\nIn reality, your mind becomes a problem way sooner than starvation. It starts with fatigue symptoms, losing your will to continue the struggle up to imagining things and even full blown hallucinations. Fear and the stress associated with it form another layer that can influence your perception and together all these factors make for a highly interesting and different survival experience.   \\nHunt or be hunted. Use the environment to your advantage. Observe your prey, study its behaviour, make and set traps to capture animals. Craft torches to scare away wolves. Make spears to throw at prey and protect yourself from apex predators that surround the area.  \\nGiven limited resources, think twice before starting a fight. A bear is a mighty predator and going against one with a knife or even a spear might not be the brightest idea. Maybe avoiding the danger or sneaking past a potential encounter is the smarter choice given the circumstance?    Gather resources, learn how to craft all sorts of useful things and build shelters and other structures to escape everyday struggles. \\nSome resources are easy to find, some are only available in certain areas, others have to be gained from hunting and some are left behind by those before you. \\nThe extended crafting system ranges from simple campfires to cook food to building entire shelters and protective structures wherever you please. It is the crafting and building system that will allow you to slowly transition from unbearable danger to a more manageable environment - if you prepare properly.   \\nIt is up to you how you want to play the game and we give you 2 different modes to choose from:  Story Mode: Learn more about yourself and people long gone while you struggle to survive. Find your friends and get back home.  Endless Mode: Take advantage of more resources and crafting options as you try to conquer the world around you.

              " Document(page_content=\": 39\\nname: Forza Motorsport (PC / Xbox Series X|S)\\ndescription: Forza Motorsport for PC is the equivalent of Forza Motorsport 8, but is more of a reboot of the original game than a follow-on: hence the name having no number next to it. It is a car racing simulation video game.     About the Game\\nThis new game features more than 500 cars with 800 upgrades (upgrades must be earned being unique to each car and earned through spending time in the car and clocking up XP), including some from every age of vehicle racing (80 from all eras) and 100 of these are new to the game.  \\nOnce you open up the game, you can participate in an Open Practice to learn the track and practice with their car, then go to the Challenge the Grid menu where you can customise your starting position, opponent difficulty, and more to challenge yourself and increase potential rewards. While pole position seems to be the best place to start, there are rewards for starting further back, so be sure to check those out before you decide.\\nWhen you’re ready, you'll race against an array of AI ‘Drivatars’ (which are new and improved and – importantly – play fair!) in the Featured Race. Once this loop has been completed, you can customize your car before moving onto the next race. Right from the beginning, you will be able to access four DLC packs.    \\nThe Builders’ Cup allows you to get hands on and go overboard with customising your car, even beyond the bounds of common sense! There is a plethora of fixes, boosts and cool gadgetry to invest in – or you can just press ‘Quick Upgrade’ and let the CPU do it all for you. \\nThe Builders’ Cup is all about developing a relationship with each car you drive — you'll slowly learn the limits of every car as you drive and tweak them, and be able to steadily improve those cars with new upgrades and parts as your experience increases. The Builders’ Cup is divided into several themed tours, and each tour has a wide array of series. \\nSeries highlight a handful of specific, all quite similar, vehicles. You choose one of these and take it through the whole series, aiming to win the championship with your chosen vehicle. As the Series progress, you'll learn more about the history of your car and how to get the most out of it. The series follow the ‘Level, Build, Dominate’ that is Forza Motorsport's motto.\\nInstead of qualifying, there's a mandatory practice session where you have to turn a minimum of three laps and hit a relatively generous target time. This can be really enjoyable, taking out the stress of qualification in favour of the sheer pleasure in driving laps.    The Nitty Gritty\\nGameplay is hugely improved from the previous version, with driving feeling much more realistic and tactile. Rather than simple lap times or even section times, the game evaluates laps on a corner-by-corner basis, giving players metrics on exactly where they were faster or slower than before, and directions on how to improve. \\nThis also ties into the move away from simple leaderboards, encouraging players to improve where they can by competing with one another in real time. Finally, endurance racing is a big new interest in the game. Players can practice and qualify for endurance races when it's convenient for them, and then return for the main event alongside other players.\\nThere are also major improvements to tire compounds, tire wear, fuel consumption, pit management, and other simulation elements, as well as redesigns of the online multiplayer experience. Other modes include (online) multi-player mode and free play.    \\nThere are 20 environments, each featuring multiple track layouts. Five new locations are featured, including South Africa’s Kyalami for the first time. Environments are detailed with lifelike vegetation, 3D spectators, and dynamic time of day, weather and track temperatures for verisimilitude. These weather factors will affect your racing, so pay attention to them.\\nLook out for the following track locations for Forza Motorsport: Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Circuit des 24 Heures du Mans (Le Mans), Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Hakone, Kyalami, Laguna Seca, Maple Valley, Silverstone Circuit, Suzuka Circuit, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, Virginia International Raceway.  Some Improvements\\nSome of the improvements in this game include:  New tyre compounds, including soft, medium, and hard options, with unique wear and handling characteristics. Players will be able to change tyres mid-race while in the pit. Major improvements to fuel consumption and other endurance racing elements. Curbs feel more natural and smoother, with tyres feedback delivering more information to players. Track and tyre temperature, and how it relates to grip, pressure, and wear, as well as other environmental factors that affect handling and driving. Suspension changes show the way cars respond to various inputs and force, including anti-dive, anti-roll, force propagation, and more. \\nForza Motorsport for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/6842/pcover/6842.jpg?v=1707321432\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 39}),\n",

Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leave… but will you be the same?SYNOPSIS\\nSet in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit.SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP\\nYou’re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players.\\nCoop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial.\\nWhatever the number of players in your party, it’s about surviving and getting out. \\nUltimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. \\nTrials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map.HIDE OR FLIGHT\\nIn pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them.\\nThe tools will allow you to  Stun enemiesBlind themSee through wallsHeal yourself and people around you.Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges.

Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think you’ll make it?   INVESTIGATE\\nYou’ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. \\nCollect documents and items that will help prove Murkoff’s malpractice against its patients.\\nThe Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subject’s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning:The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.\\nThis game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

              " Document(page_content=\": 77\\nname: EA Sports WRC\\ndescription: WRC for PC is a rally car racing video game, also known as EA Sports WRC. It is named for the World Rally Championship, from which it takes its name. This is a sequel to a previous game, but this time it is under a new developer – and the game designer is an avid rally driver, so he has been able to bring a degree of authenticity to the game that even the best other rally racing games have not been able to capture.  About the Game\\nWRC features around 78 rally cars from various categories of the real life championship for which the game is named. These include Pumas, the Hyundai i20N, the GR Yaris from Toyota and many more. There are also 68 classic rally cars for you to try out – unless you want to us Car Builder to create and customize your own car. \\nOnce you have chosen or created your perfect rally car, you can immediately hit over 200 driving stages from eighteen real rally circuits. This covers over 600 kilometres of terrain that varies from asphalt to gravel to snow. This will feel more challenging than it sounds as the tarmac psychics and changeable weather will make the vehicle respond differently according to the conditions at the time.\\nCentral Rally Europe is a latecomer to the locations, added – just as in life – in the 2023 WRC calendar. This rally starts in Prague and heads off in a challenging route through the Czech Republic, Lower Bavaria and Austria. Chile and Mexico are back, but New Zealand, Catalunya and Belgium are no longer featured.  \\nThe weather conditions are a new addition to the gameplay, and driving the exact same route in the exact same car will feel very different when the season has changed, giving you, basically, four ways to play each stage and race. Extreme weather can blight your races too, with lighting, rain and snow all take their toll on your vehicle, as does any damage you incur through racing without sufficient care and attention!\\nHowever, when condition are right, your car is beautifully responsive, going exactly where you tell it to, and letting you know when you do something wrong that makes the car misbehave. But you will learn from your mistakes and ace that particular stage or corner next time, so it’s all good! The road surfaces all feel different under your hand, so be aware of them: with tarmac feeling ‘safe’ and gravel giving a little too much under the back tyres. \\nIf you just want a quick game, you can choose quick matches in which the game makes all the decisions for you, setting you up with a car, a track and a race with no input from you. But on the other hand, if you crave control, you can do that too: customising and perfecting your car before each race and even get a feel for the track before you commit to joining the race.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game features multiplayer mode for up to thirty-two players – and it is cross-platform so your friends with other consoles could potentially race against you. There is also virtual reality mode for those who really want to feel as though they are in a rally.\\nThere are no paid microtransactions within the game. Instead you will earn XP and rewards by racing and working your way up the leaderboard. This does mean, however, that you will have to mind your budget as repairs and upgrades can cost a lot so you might end up choosing to do bare-minimum repairs to stay on the road, rather than completing restoring the car between races.  \\nIf you select beginner when you start up the game, you will be put into driving school, where you will go through training to get you road ready for your first race. It begins with basic driving skills and goes all the way up to handbrake stops and judicious speeding. The game makes sure that your car handles well when you are a newbie, gradually introducing more realistic issues as you gain the skills and knowledge to deal with them.  Ways to Play\\nOnce you are out of the rally school – if you choose beginner to start off, the game presents you with various ways to play:  Quick Play: allows you to generate a Rally Championship and play through it. You have numerous events to pick, different conditions to decide, and even fine-tune the racing experience. This is for players who want to enjoy the game in their free time Moments: are real-world highlights from the history of WRC. You relieve these moments and play through them. It’s a great addition for WRC fans who want to enjoy some of their favourite moments from the game Career mode: where you run a WRC team from scratch. You create a team to take on the gruelling World Rally Championship. You can work your way up from the bottom in Junior WRC or start straight at the top in the Rally 1 Class. You'll then work with a Chief Engineer and Benefactor, who will supply funding and give you objectives. Drive well, and you'll earn a bigger budget for hiring teammates, recruiting engineers, and buying new cars Build your own rally car mode: lets you build and test your own modern rally car from scratch. Begins with you selecting the chassis, shell, and the various mechanical components before turning your attention to the livery editor to personalise your car's appearance. You do need to stick to your budget and you might need to rely on used components to stay financially secure. Everything can be customised, right down to the mudflaps \\nWRC for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

About the Game\\nNaruto is the OG of the series, and Boruto is his son, and the protagonist of the newer stories and games: this game has the best of the old and the new, with a wealth of content from the older games and stories alongside a new Boruto-based storyline for you to play through.

This offers a great deal of replayability as you can try out all sorts of likely and unlikely combos to see who works best together – and who does not!   \\nFor those who have always struggled with the complicated series of button presses needed for fancy moves, there is a new, accessible Simple Control Mode which is great for newbies, those who just want some mindless fun and stress-free playing – and it doesn’t really detract from your interest in and engagement with the game, so it can be a win-win all round, offering different ways to play depending on your mood.\\nThe game recreates the anime’s art style, which is sure to please fans of the series, even as it shifts the torch from dad Naruto to his son, Boruto.

You can also tag out, changing your current character from one of three others during the fight.    The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game characters range from the 124 known characters to newcomers such as Asura Otsutsuki and Indra, and you can choose any of them to make up your team.

The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. \\nYou are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living.    \\nBe the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law?    \\nA morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world.    \\nEnlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments.    \\nDelve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm.    \\nPersuasive interrogations: The 1500’s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal ‘the truth’. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and it’s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation.    \\nLet your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemy’s weak points against them.Other recommended games from Kalypso Media\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/images/products/15865/616x353/the-inquisitor-deluxe-edition-deluxe-edition-pc-game-steam-cover.jpg?v=1707323581\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 103}),\n",

Otherwise, consider wishlisting anyway - who knows, we might surprise you yet!   \\nWhat makes HELLCARD unique and different from other deck-building games is that monster placement actually matters and can be used to your advantage.    HELLCARD supports co-op battles with up to three heroes facing the Archdemon's hordes. In singleplayer mode, you can descend into the dungeons solo or recruit computer-controlled companions. In multiplayer mode, your friends or strangers can help you battle the hordes of hell.       Return 2 Games is a series of unique mid-core games inspired by the golden days of PC gaming. Each R2G title is a tribute to a single hit game from the '90s: a reimagining of a single universal story for a brand-new audience, using modern means and innovative, often vastly simplified gameplay mechanics.    HELLCARD was first envisioned as a new game mode inside the Book of Demons universe, but we soon realized that its design is huge and that it should be executed as a stand-alone spin-off game. If you want to learn more about Return 2 Games or support us in the development of the series, visit the Supporter Pack store page. On release, HELLCARD will be a part of it.  Book of Demons, the first part in the series is already here, be sure to check it out as it includes a free demo.  \\nAlso, be sure to check out Book of Aliens, the second book in the series and a tribute to MicroProse’ UFO: Enemy Unknown that’s also in the works:\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/15389/pcover/15389.jpg?v=1700487886\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 105}),\n",

That alone should be enough to sell you on it, but here’s a bit more information about why you should start playing right now. It is a sandbox game in which players must mine, build, and craft to create their own ideal world.  About the Game\\nThe premise of the game is laughably simple: you arrive in the game with nothing more than your hands and a limited inventory. You mine to gather materials which you then use to make tools and build houses and other buildings.  \\nResources range from the very common to the super rare, and often the rarest and most valuable commodities are the hardest to reach, requiring deep mining and even the building of reinforced tunnels to keep flood water or rock falls from setting you back. \\nThere is no story arc, as such: it is entirely up to you as to what you want to achieve. You can build cities, or a rural mansion, you can farm sheep or go fishing. The game is exactly what you and your imagination want it to be.  Some Famous Minecraft Feats\\nIf you want to see some examples of what the game can do the following are easily findable with a quick Google:  The Eiffel Tower has been recreated in exquisite and accurate detail in the game. The careful and dedicated player even recreated the beautiful parklands nearby, so you can go and have a look-see around a part of Paris that will make you feel as though you have actually been there Kings Landing from Game of Thrones. It took 175 players two and half years to build the iconic city from the even more iconic television blockbuster. There are also a host of other fictional towns and cities from games (Sonic, Bioshock), popular culture (Star Wars), and books, such as the Lord of the Ring trilogy The medieval town of Chester in the United Kingdom has been painstakingly recreated by a man who lived nearby. He wanted a project to work on with his daughters and the picturesque old town was their favourite place to visit. Hours of careful research and crafting has seen them recreate the city in exquisite detail Working computers and iPhone. A couple of genius players have recreated a working computer – complete with programs that can be run by curious visitors – and an early edition iPhone, complete with touchscreen and apps  Some Hints for Fun Play\\nThere are no instructions about how to craft within the game, but there are a huge number of wikis and how-tos online. Find a couple of sites that seem to have all the info you need and keep the tabs open while you’re playing so that you don’t waste too much time should you forget how to craft a specific item or need a bit of info on what to do next. \\nWatch out for Creepers! These sneaky fellows will creep up on you (hence the name) utter a short hiss (just long enough to scare the pants off you but not long enough that you can run away) and then explode, killing you and damaging anything in the immediate vicinity.  \\nIf you do manage to kill a Creeper before they get you, they can drop experience pearls which are valuable and should be gathered without delay. \\nOther monsters include spiders, skeletons, zombies, witches, slimes, Endermen and endermites, and more. Each can be defeated in its own way, and learning how to do this can be a steep and thrilling learning curve! \\nAnimals and monsters are called ‘mobs’. Not because they throng around you (although they can) but because it is short for ‘mobile’ meaning that they can move around – and even wander away altogether if you are not quick at setting out after them!   Ways to Play Survival Mode: plenty of enemies, this is an exciting and engrossing level to play if you’re looking for some excitement to while away a bit of time. Creative Mode: perfect for those who want to build and see how far they can push their imagination. The world is yours to shape your way!\\nMinecraft for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 139\\nname: Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition\\ndescription: Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition for PC is the twentieth anniversary re-release of the real time strategy game which retains all the charm and popularity of the original release, but combines it with twenty years’ worth of improvements to the gaming world: ultra-high definition graphics, vastly improved gameplay and visuals and four new civilisations as well as a new single-player campaign called The Last Khans.    About the Game\\nThe major change in the programming can be found in a curious choice that players must make early in the game: whether or not to opt for the old AI as an opponent or to go for the new AI, an updated version designed specifically for the Definitive Edition release.  \\nYou may think that there should not be any real difference between the two, but the old AI was built literal generations ago when it comes to video gaming advances, and it actually needed to cheat in order to win! This was no doubt frustrating – and may still be so should you choose this option!  \\nThe new AI is sophisticated enough and has enough computing power not to need to cheat, which means that if the player is defeated, it is at least an honest win on the part of the CPU! However, a little caveat: when the two types of AI were played against each other, the new one easily defeated the old, so perhaps a canny player with ingenuity – and some luck – can beat the old system more easily than the new! The only way to find out is to try it both ways.  \\nA few systems have been tweaked to make the game more streamlined, such as being able to leave villagers in charge of farms – so there is no longer any need to return every season and tell them what to do, your farms will just replenish themselves at a steady rate. Pathfinding and managing large armies is also improved, with intuitive pathfinding coming into its own, so you can march along without any headaches while expanding your empire.   Four New Civilisations\\nThe four new civilisations mentioned above are as follows:   Bulgarians: These warlike cavalry-based soldiers advanced on the Danube valley in the 7th century, bringing with them not just domesticated horses, but stirrups that potentially changed the face of war in ancient Europe. Build forts, advance through passes, fend off invaders and attackers and take great pride in your Konnik warriors who fight first on horseback, and then on foot, and very probably from the ground as they take their dying breaths. Cumans: Nomadic tribes whose animal husbandry in the inhospitable reaches of the coldest steppes made them both feared and admired throughout the region, the fearsome, horse-back riding troops can be deployed against nearby cities to gain loot, power and territory, or they can be hired out as mercenaries to the highest bidder, fighting bloody battles to the death and boosting the reputation of anyone who has them under their command! Lithuanians: Band together the shy and secretive Baltic peoples who live in the swampy and dangerous lands into a fearsome and impressive army, under the name of the largest Duchy to be seen in late medieval Europe. Individually imposing, an army of these warlike people is a sight to cause even the bravest kings to quail!  Tatars: Fly across the plains of central Asia and Mongolia with your Great Khan as leader, riding horses as easily as walking on your own feet, wearing arrow proof armour made, almost magically, from smooth silk, attacking, retreating and advancing with a speed and mobility that modern armies would genuinely envy, against enemies who are unprepared and disbelieving of the Tatar skills in combat.\\nAge of Empires II: Definitive Edition for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 140\\nname: Red Dead Redemption 2\\ndescription: Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC is an action adventure, open world game in which the player can roam freely with some elements playing out in third person, others in first person play modes. The player can commit crimes, but must then be prepared for law enforcement to hunt them down, ready to bring to bear the full weight of the law on the miscreant!  About the Game\\nRDR2, as the game is affectionately known, was released for other platforms before the PC release, and this saw the game gaining the title of best-selling game of all time, before the PC game figures were included. The reason for the game’s popularity is not hard to see. \\nUnlike games where mayhem and destruction are key, this game allows you to sink into the beauty of the Wild West scenery, and to form empathic and sympathetic bonds with other players and NPCs (non-playing characters) in the moments between the action driven sequences – of which there are also many. \\nYou play as Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde Gang, and the linear storyline guides play through set story arcs, with Arthur completing missions and achieving objectives as he goes along, guided by the overall narrative.  \\nOnce each mission is complete, Arthur is free to wander the open world, exploring widely and uncovering new places and, occasionally, stumbling onto his next mission which he can play through before returning to his original point to continue from there. \\nDespite the tightly plotted story arcs, the game is strongly player driven, with your decisions deciding where the game will take you next. You can linger along each journey, catching villains committing crimes, helping people in distress and helping them with side missions, or you can pass them by, ignoring all the NPCs in your determination to get to your next destination.  Great Graphics\\nGiven that the game sets a high consideration on the aesthetics of the game, it will come as no surprise that huge amounts of detail have been put into creating the best looking game play, backgrounds and movement shifts possible.  \\nShadows and reflections are more detailed and realistic than ever before with higher resolution and sharper definition. Trees, grass and snow all look and ‘feel’ more authentic as you play over them, with subtle alterations in sounds helping to give a realistic impression of the terrain over which you are playing.\\nMovement is more responsive too, with drawing weapons seeming fluid, and walking, riding and running authentic as far as the graphics and physics engines are concerned.  New Features to Look Out For Horses – there are new breeds of horses for you to catch, tame and ride, including the speedy Warped Brindle Arabian; the Perlino Andalusian, an excellent hunter; the Red Chestnut Arabian, beautiful and fast; and several others. Try them all and see which best suits Arthur’s style of riding, fighting and tracking Guns – there are several guns in this game that were only available in the online version of the first game, including the High Roller Revolver and Le Mat revolver, while the M1899 pistol is entirely new to this game Talismans - keep your eyes open for gadgets and amulets that will give you aid. These include a shark tooth that helps you and your horse work as a team, a turtle shell that increases your health recovery speed (permanently) and a crow beak that boosts your looted ammo (also permanently)\\nRed Dead Redemption 2 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 141\\nname: 7 Days to Die\\ndescription: 7 Days to Die for PC began life as an early access funded horror survival game that succeeded in hitting its target and made its way onto the market as a complete and polished product. In the game, the player must survive not only enemies and combat, but simply living: finding food, water, shelter and so on are all vital to the character’s continued existence.   About the Game\\nThe basic premise of the game is that it is set in the future, in an unnamed year, following a nuclear devastation that has, it is hinted, turned much of the population to vicious zombies, leaving only a few survivors trying to eke out a living in the Nevazgane Desert, in the American south west.  \\nNevazgane means ‘killer of monsters’ in Apache, and it is into the Nevazgane Desert that the player spawns, naked, alone and (presumably) afraid. The survival theme continues with the laws of physics applying to buildings which will fall down if not properly constructed and to tools and weapons which wear out or degrade over time, thus needing constant replenishment.  \\nThis all means that the character is constantly on the lookout for plants, tools and resources which can be found in nature – plants, minerals, building rocks – and in the ruined remnants of cities – tools, clothing and other resources, with which they can restore their inventory and keep on advancing through the game.  \\nMultiplayer games are an option and you can choose whether to team up with buddies – or strangers – as a team for co-operative play, making your way through the hostile landscape and fending off the zombie hordes as a team, or you can play against other players in hostile games when you will have to husband your resources by yourself and try and fend off both zombies and other players at once or in tandem, depending on the difficulty level at which you are playing.  In-Game Hazards\\nDespite the already arduous conditions in which just trying to stay alive can kill you, there are a number of ways to die or be defeated in the game:  Starve/ Freeze/ Waste Away: This is the sort of day-to-day attrition that requires near constant vigilance to stave off, with gathering resources, finding food, and renewing weaponry that will keep you engrossed and active in the game. Predators: As you are gathering food and resources, so too are predatory creatures who think that you would be a great addition to their menu and sooner rather than later! Stay vigilant for these creatures and be prepared for a fight to the death: yours or theirs. Zombies: These undead are your greatest hazard, and will force you into planning excursions with care as they will follow you relentlessly, greatly cramping your style and making you use up your resources more rapidly than you might want to. These creatures slowly become stronger and more aggressive, undermining your defences and causing you a great deal of trouble. Seven-Day Zombies: If the usual zombies haven’t been enough to see you off, every seven days (and this is from where the title of the whole game comes) an apocalyptic flood of the bloodthirsty creatures are unleashed upon you, all at the same time, flocking to your location, and all bent on taking you out. This is the greatest test of your defences, and you will have to work very hard before and during the attack to stave them off and survive to the next week.\\n7 Days to Die for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 142\\nname: God of War\\ndescription: God of War for PC was teased for months, from about halfway through 2021 until the developers finally put players out of their misery and confirmed the PC release in January 2022! It is the PC-friendly version of the 2018 Gods of War, which was initially only available on PlayStation. The game allows PC gamers to enjoy the intense Norse God action-adventure game.  \\nThe game is the eighth in the whole cross-platform series and takes place against a background that while not really being open world and more a series of linked locations, is still wide and explorable within those locations. You seldom feel constrained despite the linear game progression. About the Game\\nThe game’s plot plays out against the background of Norse gods in this iteration, rather than the Ancient Greece of the original games, and it is loosely set in Medieval Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard, which is the Norse equivalent of the lands inhabited by the earliest humans when the world was young.  \\nThere are two protagonists in the game, one of whom is playable. Kratos – a former Greek God of War and only playable character – is accompanied by his young son, Atreus, who looks to be anywhere between eight years old and twelve or so. The two of them are on an honour quest, to dispose of Faye’s (Atreus’s mother) ashes according to her deathbed wish, to have her remains scattered on the highest peak of the nine realms. \\nOf course, there would be no story if everything went smoothly, and so, their quest is disrupted by monsters and gods who have other ideas about who should be able to dispose of their earthly remains on the sacred peak. The monsters start off large and scary and steadily get larger and scarier, giving you plenty of scope to improve your skills and then try them out. The combat is wonderful: bloody, brutal and – thanks to the physics engine – satisfying!  \\nAlmost equally satisfying and rare in a game better known for skull-shattering crunches and broken bones, is the arc between Kratos and Atreus. When they set off, they are almost strangers to each other, both feeling that the other expects more of them than they give. This arc progresses along with the game, ending with a much closer, more respectful and loving relationship between the two. And all without impacting the joyous blood-shed!   The Nitty Gritty\\nTake a moment before you play, to customise your PC settings to suit your CPU to get the best possible results. You will think it well worth the time, when you see the beautiful scenery that makes even the quiet parts a wonderful experience. During the action sequences you will be too busy to notice your surroundings unless it offers a handy cave to hide in, or rock to shelter behind while you catch your breath!  \\nGameplay is equally fluid with either a PlayStation controller (PS4 or PS5 are recommended) or a gaming keyboard and mouse, depending on your set-up and preferences. To celebrate the PC release, Sony gave out some extra content, a number of new skins and even some free armour for you to try on for size.  \\nDo enjoy the game: the original version won multiple (around 190!) Best Game awards, and for good reason. The action is ‘filmed’ in a continuous shot, the focus of which is always Kratos and his son, making it immediately immersive. The filming style isn’t kitschy or artsy though, it all flows seamlessly, leaving you breathless as you closely accompany your hero. \\nAtreus is AI at its best, interacting almost naturally, but also obediently following instructions and enabling you to double your strike rate and power if you time your actions with his – something that the pros make look easy to do!  \\nTake your time exploring the worlds and learning about the mythology and hidden secrets of the world, or gallop through to finish quickly and then return to cover the bits you missed. There are at least 20 hours or so of content that is not directly related to the game, just waiting to be enjoyed when you explore the beautifully rendered world to its limits.  What Weapons are There?\\nThe game has used the Norse myths to come up with some fabulous weapons for Kratos and Atreus to try out:  The Leviathan Axe: Kratos’s axe is something like Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir, in that it returns when summoned. Time your throws neatly, so you can get two enemies for the price of one – one on the way out, and the other on the way back to you. The Leviathan Axe can be powered up, so keep checking for boosters AI Archery: Atreus’s bow and arrow is always with him, and comes in handy as he accompanies you on your battles, taking out enemies while you are otherwise occupied Hand combat: Kratos’s ‘Rage of the Gods’ mode gives him a super pummel power that takes a simple punch (albeit already a hugely powerful one) into another dimension  Retractable Shield: Kratos’s gauntlet holds a sneaky secret. The full size shield pops out and staves off arrows, unwary fists, and spears – as long as you deploy it in time, that is! Runic Wolf Spirit Attack – Atreus has various runic attacks, that summon help when he needs it. Such as a giant spectral wolf who attacks enemies three times before vanishing once again Armor: Everything that Kratos wears can be customised – and all of it makes a difference! Be wary about making his armour too thick as this can slow him down, for example. With every upgrade, you will have to weigh up various stats: defence over agility, for example, so think about each option and choose wisely! \\nGod of War for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 143\\nname: Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition\\ndescription: Horizon Zero Dawn for PC is an action role playing game in which you control Aloy, a rare human survivor in the 31st century dystopian landscape.  \\nHumans may be rare, and access to technology is limited, but there is a large population of unfriendly robotic creatures (who were originally created by Big Tech who then lost control of them).  About the Game\\nAloy gets by in life by cannibalising the remains of the robotic creatures for electrical components that enable her own survival. She can also use other parts of the creatures to craft weapons and equipment that help her survive and succeed. The machine creatures band together, rather like real life wildlife herds, and will not usually attack one another unless they have been subject to corruption arrows or have been hacked with an Override Tool. \\nHowever, they do attack when they sense a threat, but they do tend to use brute force rather than finesse, and they all have differing attack and defence modes. Your various weapons have modification slots that allow you to boost weapons’ offensive capabilities for more dramatic effects, and Aloy wears a small head-mounted scanner called Focus that helps her zone in on her prey. However, The Stalker, in particular, can avoid this with stealth cloaking technology.  \\nAloy also battles human enemies: there are bandits and a creepy cult to keep clear of, amongst others. Aloy was rejected by her tribe when she was younger, then being adopted and taught all she knows by Rost, her father figure. But she wants to find the truth – no spoilers are forthcoming, other than to say it’s well worth tracing through the narrative as Aloy learns that not only does her identity exist, but that she can change the entire shape of humanity altogether.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThere are various skill trees, that bear unusual names for recognisable skills: Prowler means stealth, Braves are excellent at combat and Foragers are skilled at gathering and healing. You will progress up the skill tree based on your experience from completing quests and making kills, and open out new areas of the map by climbing up the nearest Tall Neck to literally broaden your horizons! Tall Necks are immense, giraffe-like robot creatures. \\nThe map includes a variety of terrains to playthrough, and there is the option for fast travel if you only have a short time to play and want to get on with the quest – otherwise it is more fun to take your time! These terrains include jungles and forests, deserts, and snowy mountains – where your parkour skills come in handy. The open world game has a night and day cycle and dynamic weather to make things more fun. \\nAs well as Tall Necks, there are Striders which are the robotic equivalent of horses, and you can tame yourself one to gain a speedy and obedient mode of transportation. There are also truly immense creatures that appear to be the size of an entire village, that will wow you, even as you work out how to bring it down! \\nCorruption Zones dot the map and are harder to cross, with corrupted machines that are more aggressive and will actively attack. There are plenty of collectibles and signs of the ‘old world’ all around, many of which are valuable and should be gathered when possible.  \\nTo get through the game, Aloy must help other friendlies, complete quests, gather materials, and solve mysteries, not least of which is the mystery of her own life. \\nPro-tip: be on the special look-out for a suit of ancient armour that renders Aloy all but indestructible…   Aloy’s Movements to Master Dodge – get the timing right and Aloy can step out of range effortlessly, giving herself valuable time to take out the enemy Sprint – it is always useful to put on a good turn of speed when necessary! Slide – practise this niche skill that will get Aloy out of an enemy’s range or to a treasure before anyone else. It also looks cool! Roll – there is something about having your character duck and roll that looks and feels amazing as you creep up on unaware enemies, ready to sneak past them or into their domain! Swim – take to the water to glide silently past vigilant hostiles and also get to places that are inaccessible on foot Hide – sometimes Aloy will need to lure hostiles into a trap. To this end, she can hide and wait to ambush the unwary as they pass Parkour – sometimes there is no obvious up or over an obstacle. Put Aloy’s parkour into action and bounce, flip and somersault into tricky places Zipline – these useful wire cables can get Aloy from up here to down there in a flash!\\nHorizon Zero Dawn for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 144\\nname: Grand Theft Auto V\\ndescription: Grand Theft Auto V for PC is an action adventure game, the fifth in the GTA series. As with the other games in the series, you score points by committing crimes. The game alternates between third-person narrative and play and first-person play, and you play as three criminals trying to avoid a determined government agency and committing heists. You do not pick just one character to play as, the game’s narrative jumps from one character to the next.  About the game\\nThe game is set in the fictional town of San Andreas which is based loosely on generic southern California life. While much of the game’s scripted action takes place in the city, the world is much larger than previous GTA offerings, and players can explore freely. The city lies in Blaine County, near another city, Los Santos (both also fictional) and all areas can be accessed from the beginning of the game.  Fully Operational Towns!\\nHowever, some gameplay needs to be unlocked in the open map area, before you can get the full flavour of what the game has to offer. But it is well worth exploring as you play, or in between the linear missions: Los Santos boasts a fully operational golf course, tennis courts, you can go to the races – there is even a stock market that you can watch for fluctuations. Movie theatres allow you to watch a movie if you want some downtime, or you help to mug (or save from being mugged) an unsuspecting passer-by, you can collect vehicles, or even rob an armoured van – whatever you fancy when the situation arises in the game! \\nThe story is centred around the heist action and there are plenty of shooting and driving scenarios to keep players engaged and interested. Players use melee attacks, explosions and firearms to defeat their enemies, and can drive, swim, run and jump to move around the world. Exploring the wider world, you can even steal planes and fly over the terrain to cut down travel times. \\nThe game is very immersive, almost like an interactive movie rather than a game, with the actions interspersed with plenty of driving conversations and connecting scenes to watch while you wait for your next opportunity to shoot up a bank or commit a heist.  If You Can’t Do the Time…\\nYour criminality puts a target on your back so do bear that in mind when being lawless! The worse the crime you commit the higher on the ‘wanted’ list you are – and this impacts on how aggressively law enforcement will behave towards you when they catch up with you. If they do!  Make a Feature Film! \\nDirector mode is a new feature of this version of GTA, and it allows you to explore the world as any character but with an artistic, creative eye. You can record pieces of footage, then cut and edit it into a short film – you can do this while still following the narrative arc of the game, or while you are exploring in and around Blaine County. More about Director Mode below. \\nBe spontaneous – you can buy a vehicle and break into the airport to do wheelies on the runway, only to find an easily accessible plane that you can hop into and fly away, off to elsewhere for a completely unexpected adventure!  Ways to Play Single Player \\nPlayers must complete the linear missions in order to progress in the game, but it is a matter of individual choice as to whether you blast through all the levels to unlock all areas and upgrades for leisurely exploration of the open world later, or if you want to take your time, exploring assets and areas as they unlock as you savour your journey through the game.  Multiplayer\\nA massive online offering where up to thirty players can join in, more about which on Grand Theft Auto V Premium Online Edition   Director Mode\\nAs mentioned above, this way of playing allows you to make movies. You can opt for humorous montages – slips, trips or close-ups of ridiculous action shots, or let out your inner Spielberg and use the full range of editing and cutting tools to craft high-quality footage.  \\nThe game is rendered with exquisite attention to detail, from the garbage bags littering the back alleys to the splendour of the sunset caught in character’s sunglasses – there is nothing left out and all can be displayed to good effect in your film. However, be warned, if you die while ‘filming’, you lose your footage and have to start again! \\nGrand Theft Auto V for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

About the Game\\nThis game is the official race of Blancpain GT Racing, and is officially licenced by Blancpain. This means that the tracks and vehicles feel authentic, and all the data generated within the game can even be enough to help the engineers and mechanics with innovations that will help real world cars improve their racing performance.  \\nThe player’s experience is designed to feel as real as possible with a range of weather conditions, accurate visibility and minutely detailed instrument panel: you will almost feel as though you are in a real car – and racing for the win.  What is Blancpain GT Racing\\nThis type of racing is not nearly as popular or well-known as its close cousins, Formula One and MotoGP, but it enjoys a popular following amongst those who are passionate about Grand Touring races. \\nThe full title is the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup, and the contest gets its name from its main sponsor, luxury watch manufacturer Blancpain (headquarted in Switzerland, Blancpain is the worlds oldest surviving watchmaking company, having been incorporated in 1735. Their watches are owned by people as diverse as Russian leader Vladimir Putin and American movie star Brad Pitt. \\nThe races in the series tend towards endurance races, with differences between the cars carefully assessed and allowances or weightings made to even these out – much like handicapping in horse racing. This is to give every driver the opportunity to win their races on their skill alone, rather than relying on superior engine power or design innovations.  Seven Races to Try\\nWithin the game, there are seven races to choose from, depending on what you want to try and how much time you have on your hands. The earlier races can be looked at as a sort of training ground for the later ones where you will need serious skills, stamina and endurance to get yourself over the finish line with a place:  Free Practice: as it sounds, get to grips with your machine, and it is sure to be a sweet ride.

              " Document(page_content=': 149\\nname: Dark Souls 3\\ndescription: Dark Souls 3 for PC is a fantasy action role-playing game, the fourth in the series and a close follow-on from its immediate predecessor, Dark Souls 2. The game is set in a fictional universe, in the Kingdom of Lothric, where are lengthy period of enlightenment (literally) is being threatened by the coming of the Age of Dark. The player must ensure the survive of the Age of Fire by ensuring that the First Flame continues to burn a while longer.  About the Game\\nThe player takes on the third-person persona of the Ashen One, who is tasked with ‘linking’ the First Flame to keep it burning. The flame is fuelled by the sacrifices of heroes and champions, who willingly sacrifice their souls to the flame, thereby becoming Lords of Cinder. This has happened in an unbroken line from times gone by until now. The Ashen One failed to link the flame and has not become a Lord of Cinder, instead being known as an Unkindled. \\nThe Ashen One arises as the player enters the game, and is given the mission of returning the Prince Lothric and the rebellious Lords of Cinder to their rightful places, their thrones in Firelink Shrine. The flame is dying because Prince Lothric has defied his destiny: he must be persuaded otherwise. \\nSuccessfully returning the Lords of Cinder and the Prince, they travel on to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame: at this point, after the defeat of the Soul of Cinder, there are four potential endings, more about which see below.  Battles and Treasures and Weapons, Oh My\\nIn the course of his mission, the Ashen One must battle using a variety of weapons, that range from bows to swords to throwable projectiles, with shields and evasive manoeuvres an important skill to learn. Each weapon has a standard use and a boost: a powered-up version which must be used sparingly as it does not last long and takes a bit of time to reset once depleted.\\nHe will also battle a wide range of creatures, many of them grisly and in keeping with the spectral, supernatural theme of the game. Watch out for skeletal hounds, various hostile lizard-men, the undead in forms that range from skeleton to blood-thirsty knight to the revolting Pus of Man, an enemy who transforms from vaguely normal man-shape into a hideous abyss-tainted corruption. Enemies drop resources though, so be sure to grab them all. \\nThe Ashen One can use magic by acquiring FP (focus points) which are used up whenever a spell is cast. Hit Points (HP) is used when taking damage from enemies, and both of these are refilled through estus flasks, magical healing vessels that can be upgraded up to seven times for maximum benefit.  Ending It All\\nThere are four potential endings after the Soul of Cinder has been defeated. They are as follows: Link the Flame: The player can attempt to link to the First Flame, ensuring that the Age of Fire will continue Summon the Fire Keeper: The Fire Keeper will extinguish the flame and the Age of Dark will begin in earnest Kill the Fire Keeper: This is much like the ending above, except after summoning the Fire Keeper, you kill her. Note: you will not receive any end game achievements for playing out this ending. The Fire Keeper will respawn as soon as you leave the area, so you can come back and try again Keep the Flame: The Ashen One can choose to keep the flame for themselves, an option which results in his becoming the Dark Lord of Londor\\nDark Souls 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 153\\nname: Days Gone\\ndescription: INCLUDES: \\n• New Game Plus \\n• Survival Mode\\n• Challenge Mode\\n• Bike Skins \\nPC features include ultra-wide monitor support, unlocked framerates and improved graphics (increased level of details, field of view, foliage draw distances). \\nDays Gone for PC is an action adventure survival horror game set in a dystopian future in the state of Oregon. The game begins two years after the start of a global pandemic which killed most people and turned a lot of the rest into ‘Freakers’ which are mindless proto-zombies who are nocturnal and constantly evolving throughout the game, which is a great way to prevent the player becoming complacent!  About the Game\\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective with the playing taking on the persona of Deacon St John. Deacon is on a mission to find his wife, last seen being evacuated to a camp later overrun by Freakers. However, Deacon has heard a rumour that his wife’s political influence might have been enough to have her bounced on to an even more secure location – and it is his hope that this is what has happened and that her can find her again soon. \\nThe open world game gives you plenty of scope for exploration and you can use all sorts of things to defend yourself: from melee weapons, firearms for long shots and even improvised weapons when you are in a bind. Or, if the pacifist route is your favourite, you can also use stealth to dodge Freakers, and other people. Hostile uninfected humans include cultists called Rippers, and there are various militia and government bodies to assess for friendliness. \\nDeacon’s best form of travel is a motorbike, and it is so much more than just his mode of transportation. The vehicle holds much of your inventory, and also allows for ‘fast travel’ without which the game slows to a very sluggish pace indeed! \\nThe game has a dynamic day-night system which is highly important to your progress and success, as the Freakers are slow and weak by day, but scarily fast and strong at night – not creatures you want to meet down a dark alley, low on both fuel and ammo!  The Nitty Gritty\\nAs you play along the overarching story-line, there are plenty of missions and side quests to keep you occupied. Finishing missions completes some story lines and opens up other avenues of exploration. Sometimes these story-lines split up on themselves, so you can choose from more than one at a time – ideal if you need to wait for the right upgrade or resource in one thread as you can complete another in the meantime. \\nCombat moves feel satisfying and they come with skill trees that helps Deacon in a number of ways, from Deacon’s aim, to fighting melee battles with improvised weapons – these are particularly gory and satisfying.  \\nThe graphics are great too: Oregon has some truly beautiful scenery with rolling mountains, lush forests and detailed little towns, all of which respond to the weather changes which can jump from beautifully sunny warm days to full-on snow storms – so keep an eye on the clouds!  Deacon’s Motorbike\\nAs mentioned above, Deacon St John’s motorbike is almost a character in its own right, and can benefit from cosmetic customisation at the beginning of the game, and also enjoys a range of power-ups and upgrades along the way. When choosing which upgrades to go for first, try these:  Fuel capacity. You are not going anywhere without fuel in the tank, and you don’t know when you will get your hands on any more – so make sure a fill up gives you plenty of range! Speed is all you need! Well, not quite – but it is important and makes sure you can fast-travel across the map to complete missions and side quests and get the next chunk of story exposition under way Durability is essential in any dystopia, and your bike is all that stands between you and a much more uncomfortable life, some days, so look after it! Deacon tinkers endlessly with his bike, trying to make it stronger, while every encounter with Freakers or hostiles sees it taking damage that must be repaired promptly so it doesn’t worsen Manoeuvrability is also a good thing, when driving through Freaker hordes, dodging irate militia, and avoiding capture by the Rippers – whose name origins you really do not want to explore!  Ammo storage. The more bullets you have, the easily and clearer you path can be! More ammo is always useful, so make sure you can maximise the amount you carry!\\nPro Tip! Going for the first two items on the list early on in the game, speed and fuel capacity, means that you can quickly make those early milestones without being bored or needing to hunt about for supplies. The other upgrades can come later once you can get where you need to without too much fuss. \\nDays Gone for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 154\\nname: Crusader Kings III\\ndescription: Crusader Kings III for PC is a grand strategy game, albeit with many role-playing game (RPG) elements, that is set in the middle ages. It covers civilisations that run from the Viking age to the Fall of Byzantium, and offers the player two start dates: 867AD or 1066AD. The game, like its two predecessors, is based on national dynastic interplay but rooted in almost entirely in character.  How to Begin?\\nThe previous iteration of the game was universally agreed to be one of the most complicated games and came with little in the way of a tutorial. This version is much more user friendly, and there is an island nation, based on Ireland but called by popular demand ‘Newbie Island’, which serves as a tutorial base.  \\nThere are also ‘tooltips’ which lead into a rabbit-hole of information in which you click on one topic, highlight a word you want to understand further opening another info-sheet, on which there are yet more words or tooltips to explore. The UI (user interface) of the tips is as user friendly as possible, which is just as well as it houses a huge amount of data, which can seem daunting when you are chasing an answer that you need! \\nIt is reassuring that it is there when you need though! And, there is little that the database does not have buried somewhere within its depths, so you can find the answers to all possible questions (and probably some impossible ones too!) with a little searching.   Customise your Characters\\nThe fully rendered 3D characters that you are playing with in this game are a huge improvement to the last one, and there are some developments that take it up a level into the almost fabulous. Your characters will age over time, showing the results of too much stress, too much wine and food, battle scars form part of their look and their hair will slowly grey or go thin. They can also pass on their features to their children. \\nThis sounds like a small thing and remarkably obvious, but seeing the result of your brunette beauty mixed with Nordic muscle adds to the realism and authenticity of the game’s narrative. One thing that this genetic accuracy can do too, is pass along the effects of incest. So if your dynastic family decides to go full GoT by keeping it all in the family, their desirable traits will slowly warp, over a generation or two into disability and distortion. \\nWhen picking out your first characters, you will find that they come with a fairly detailed psyche already, but to save time they are given a pithy epithet that encapsulates their core character, so you can grab a ‘plucky optimist’ alongside a ‘depressed scribe’ without ending up with characters at odds with the actions you want them to take. \\nThe personalities and quirks of the characters are tremendously important to the overall gameplay: it is amazing how a character can influence such huge national reactions!  Features of the Game\\nThe main overarching purpose of the game is to expand your empire as far as possible, and to paint the map in your empire’s colours. And what a map it is! On the surface a beautifully authentic ‘hand-drawn’ looking chart, but zooming in brings out ever more details about the area you are looking at, to an almost insane level of detail. The terrain is diverse and interesting, each region has geological quirks and there are special buildings to explore too!  \\nAll that map exploration comes in handy as you train and supply your army, before sending them off to achieve your aims in lands as yet unknown. Keep a few loyal soldiers around your court though, to protect your empire and family – or to protect you from your family!  \\nCultural traits are important and you can customise these, as well as coming up with your own religion if you are not impressed with any of those on offer in the game! However – do not go too wild with blood-thirsty and savage behaviour, even if it is the law of your theocracy that five slaves must be sacrificed on a Friday morning!  \\nStress in this game is a literal killer, and it builds up in each character each time they go out of their comfort zone. Even the most vicious king needs to show mercy occasionally to keep their stress levels down, while betraying friends, committing acts of disloyalty or treason can upset good characters and so on.  \\nSome moral choices seem bad either way: should you agree to sleep with your son, or just have him killed rather than risk the hit to your stress? Will that not stress you out in turn? You can, however, make naked Wednesdays a thing without worrying about the stress – hopefully, you’ll all be laughing too much for the stress levels to be impacted at all!   Career Paths to Success\\nThere are five career paths to success and some of them can open unexpected doors for you:  Diplomacy – the art of sweet-talking people into going along with your ideas Intrigue – spying on the enemy, schmoozing with them, and then betraying them for the glory of your own empire. Winning!  Warfare – the straightforward world of combat Learning – study old documents, secret arts and new skills – and perhaps present your own candidate for the throne, or yourself, why not? You know you don’t deserve it, but they don’t… Stewardship – looking after kings and their families is an excellent way to discover all the hidden places and secrets of court! Then use them – carefully, watch out for that stress! – to spin things to your own advantage! \\nThis is a long and in-depth game – not for when you have an hour to kill! You can rack up literally hundreds of hours of play time: but you will still not be bored and be finding new things to try even after your empire is into its third or fourth generation! \\nCrusader Kings III for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Expand your experience with the Season Pass featuring new maps, bosses, enemies and additional weapon and armor sets.  About the Game \\nThe game is a fantasy tale with a strong surreal Japanese influence which gives it a spooky supernatural vibe. Loosely the premise is to kill monsters and harness their souls, which are then parlayed into rises in level. Should you be killed before you can trade in the souls you are carrying, they are lost and you respawn at your last resting place, usually a bonfire.  \\nYou can, if you’re quick, gather up the souls before they scatter too far – but if you are killed again before you get them all, they are gone for good. \\nThe screen can be filled with enemies which can be alarming – and it also encourages the rapid learning of tactical thinking! Quickly take out the ‘easy’ enemies, sneak up on and despatch the muscle, and pay careful attention to stronger, cunning enemies that are likely to unleash something nasty on you should you relax for an instant!  They’re Bosses for a Reason!\\nBosses levels are intensely challenging, and some of them will leave you wrung out and exhausted, hands shaking and brain as traumatised as though you had been battling for your life for real! Tactics are your friends here, observe the enemy, looking for patterns and weaknesses as well as their strengths and the hell they can unleash on you. \\nMake sure you go into any boss level with a well-stocked inventory, plenty of ammunition and a clean bill of health: you will need all of it! However, the beauty of these challenging levels is the rush of victory when you do finally beat them: you get a real sense of accomplishment.  What a View \\nEvery now and then, your character will climb to the top of a mountain, or find a sweeping panoramic view. Pay careful attention at these times as there is no handy game map for you to consult: you have to work out your own navigation based on clues provided by NPCs (non-playing characters) and these occasional wide-ranging glimpses. \\nAlso pay careful attention to the apparently empty bits of the landscape – say, travelling from your latest battle towards the next hit of action glimpsed from on high somewhere. Sometimes the most innocuous decision – let’s have a look in this gully, for example – can lead you to discover a whole hidden level, or a shortcut that will save you hours, blood, sweat and inventory items!  Ways to Play  Single player (PvP or Player versus Player): When you’re looking for a challenge you can leave a summon symbol where another player can find it. When they tap on it, they’re brought to your world, ready to do battle with you. It is the same if you want to be challenged by another player: simply leave a signal that the other player can initiate to pull you into their world, and the hostilities can commence!  Co-operative multiplayer: This works in a broadly similar way to summoning and being summoned for single-player battles. The main difference is in the symbols used, and where they are left: signals – for either co-op or PvP – that are left in remote, rarely visited areas of the map are unlikely to be triggered!   For both of the above, if you want to get together with a specific group of buddies, you all enter the same password into the Online tab of the Settings menu: everyone with the same password will be ported to the same area  Multiplayer: Explore the game with a good internet connection and battle or help out any other players who cross your path.

              " Document(page_content=': 159\\nname: Risk of Rain 2\\ndescription: Risk of Rain 2 for PC is a third-person shooter game (also styled an ‘action-platformer’) that falls into the roguelike classification. ‘Roguelike’ refers to a category of role-playing video games in which permadeath (or the permanent death of a playing character) is a feature, but the term has, of late, expanded to include many others: often needing to be a turn-based game, procedurally generated levels, tile-based graphics and a high-fantasy world setting.   About the Game\\nOne to four players fight to advance from level to level, combatting waves of aliens and bosses. The premise is that the players must locate and then guard a teleport until it becomes active. The more kills that are made, the more experience and in-game currency you earn, the latter being used to purchase upgrades and boosts. Some of the upgrades are ‘stackable’ meaning that their benefits are exponentially increased when more than one is used at any one time. \\nThe strength, difficulty and numbers of the attacking aliens increases every five minutes, making each level harder and harder as time goes on. This means it behoves the player to work through the levels as quickly as possible, so as to move on to the next level with its attendant benefits and powers – and the reduced numbers and strengths of attackers that marks the first few minutes on a new level! \\nHowever, along with the increase in enemy activity, your character gets stronger too, so that what was a boss fight a few moments ago becomes a regular battle. This maintains a high level of excitement and encourages focussed concentration on the action, making for a compelling and enthralling challenge.  Randomised Fully 3D World\\nThe world is set in fully 3D rendered locations, which adds dynamism to the gameplay, and because of the randomising engine, each time you play will take you along a slightly different path as the game responds to your choices and actions each time you play through a level, even if you are going over previously completed levels.  Ways to Play  Focus\\nPay attention to the patterns of enemy waves – they do adhere to very similar patterns of arrival each time. This means that with skill and care, even the toughest level can be mastered in time. It is possible to win the game more on statistics and observation than by blunt-force skill, so you can set yourself a challenge of using more finesse and accuracy rather than non-stop shoot-em-up action.  Solo\\nPlay by yourself, running on sheer grit to keep enemy numbers down, using all your weapons and upgrades to stay ahead of the curve. This is where your love of noise and violence can be indulged, spraying enemies with missiles and cutting down wave after wave of aliens, monsters and bosses.  Multiplayer\\nTeam up with up to three other players to work as a team to divide and conquer the streams of enemies. This is a more efficient way of playing as one player can devote their attention to one quarter of the invaders, with all four players working in concert to cover each other against attack from all sides. Solo players sometimes run the risk of being ambushed when streams of invaders suddenly arrive from an unexpected direction. \\nRisk of Rain 2 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 161\\nname: Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition\\ndescription: Age of Empires IV for PC is a real time strategy game, the fourth in the Age of Empires series and a staggering fifteen years after the third version.  \\nThis version is set in the Middle Ages and has a lot of involvement with the Norman Conquest. If you were a big fan of the third game, way back when, you will be able to carry over some of the game mechanics from that game to this new and improved platform.   About the Game\\nThere are four historical documentary-style campaigns to work through, as well as the series’ first nomads. The nomads are the Mongols, who look to be very interesting, having the first mobile base ever seen in these types of real-time strategy civilisation-building games. They were in the second game, but static, like the other civilisations mentioned. \\nThe four campaigns are: the Norman Conquest; the 100-Years War; the Mongol Empire: and the Rise of Moscow. There will be wall combat, battles at sea and siege weapons will make short work of some fortifications, so build yours well!  \\nYou will begin the game at your base, gathering wood and stone to build simple structures at first, slowly increasing in size and strength. You will also be training troops (in groups of 200 or so) before sending them out to win territory in your name.  \\nYour choice of civilisation matters: each of the civilisations work differently, fight differently, and generally make it clear that they are not the same as the others. There is some scope for blurring when you can bring elements of one civilisation into another, but these are carefully tailored for possible authenticity, that is to say, if the civilisations communicated or were geographically close, it is possible that influences spread from one to the other.  \\nAs you progress through the years, your civilisation changes in a fairly authentic way, progressing from early medieval language to more sophisticated grammar and syntax. This happens in all the civilisations and was a deliberate feature, and the game developers sought out speakers and scholars of the ancient languages for verisimilitude.   What’s New?\\nIn this game, the focus is deliberately wide, looking at the nation as a whole entity, rather than looking at individuals. This works surprisingly well, and do look out for quirky things like being able to hide your army in the forest, where they will be hidden unless an enemy scout saunters past them, unable to see them. They will whisper to you until battle commences and they can drop their concealment, resuming normal speaking voices. \\nEnjoy ‘live action’ drone style-footage which is a new and realistic-looking feature, and narration can be activated during real life battles and events so you can follow exactly what’s going on. The game features fabulous music, which comes from the composer who created the Witcher 3 soundtrack.   Who Can I Be?\\nThere are eight civilisations preloaded with the game:   The English – fighting the Norman invasion and changing the way the small island nation is governed forever The Chinese – known for lengthy dynasties, the in-between times were always exciting in China. The game deals with a short but brutal time when assassination was practically a natural cause of death for an emperor The Mongols – under the unparalleled leadership of Genghis Khan, this warlike people swept across much of Asia until they had an immense empire The Delhi Sultanate – a kind of precursor to the Ottoman Empire, the Sultanate was a series of five Muslim dynasties that ruled over much of India at its peak. The big selling point of playing this civilisation is that it has cavalry elephants! The French – trapped in a seemingly never-ending war with the British, the Hundred Years War was in fact a series of mini-wars. With both sides evenly matched and equally hungry for victory, both countries were caught up in a cycle of war and peace for about 107 years in total The Abbasid Dynasty – another Muslim dynasty, this one was descended from the uncle of the prophet Muhammad, whose name was Abbas. This one stretched over much of the Near East and was a formidable military power when the Mongols came looking to extend their sphere of influence into the region The Holy Roman Empire – the descendant of perhaps the best known empire, certainly the most pernicious (save perhaps the later British Empire) by the time of the game, the Holy Roman Empire, under the Vatican, was somewhat reduced from Roman Empire glories, spreading merely across much of Europe, as opposed to its previous territories which were as far afield at the UK, Africa and Western Asia The Rus – the name implies that they are Russian, and certainly that part of the world was included in the Rus Empire. However, it also included a number of Slavic and Eastern European countries in its number. Like many great empires it peaked and then began to decline, crumbling entirely within a few decades of its zenith\\nAge of Empires IV for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 162\\nname: Nioh 2: The Complete Edition\\ndescription: Nioh 2: The Complete Edition for PC is an action roleplaying game, in this release complete (as the name implies) with all previously released DLC for a compact download and gameplay experience. In the first game, players had to play as the Western Samurai, William Adams (based on a real historical character), but in this version, you can choose his appearance as a costume, if you like, being instead a Yokai, or mystical creature/ spirit from Japanese folklore.  About the Game\\nThe character customisation is highly intricate with plenty of detailed choices and you can immediately return to the creation studio if you don’t like the way your character looks in the rather different lighting of the game. This ensures that you have a character whose looks and clothing you are completely happy with, and you can even share a code that lets other players use your customisation as their characters.  \\nBeing a Yokai brings you powers you would not have as a human, and you can play as both, being Hide, a Shiftling, or half Yokai, half human hybrid. However, playing as a Yokai drains your Anima, so keep an eye on the health bars, and make sure you grab the soul core of any hostile Yokai you defeat. If you get it to a shrine quickly, you will harvest that Yokai’s powers and gain the ability to transform into them for a time. \\nElemental Guardian Spirits give you strength against certain element enemies with Burst Counters which are excellently offensive defensive moves, Places called Benevolent Graves bring you AI companions who can help you in battle, or you can summon three real life friends for three-players cooperative multiplayer mode, adding some real life quirkiness to your gameplay.  \\nUnusually for a second game in a series, Nioh2 is actually both the sequel and the prequel to the original, with the first part of gameplay occurring before the events in the original, and the latter portion dealing with subsequent events.  \\nThe story begins in the late 1500s, and the player’s character, Hide, befriends a merchant, Tokichiro who is aiming to make his mark on history by selling Amrita (which is mysterious god/ spirit/ demon energy used as an informal currency) and Mumyo, the leader of one of the tribe’s, who has been alerted to strange goings-on and come to sort out the Yokai she holds responsible for everything that has gone wrong...  \\nThe antagonist of the game, Kashin Koji, is a mysterious entity who harasses the party at every turn. He is from Hide’s past, and Hide must find out exactly who and what in order to restore harmony to the land. There are plenty of skills to learn, so beginners won’t be tackling the harder levels too soon, but they will enjoy a satisfying growth arc as they master the levels.  \\nOne skill to master as quickly as you can is Ki Pulse. At the end of an attack or combo, your stamina gauge turns white and refills quickly. By pressing at exactly the right moment, you can be back to full stamina in a trice, but you must press at the right time – too soon and you’re only half filled, too late and you miss it completely. Should the latter happen, the stamina resets and you must wait for the bar to fill at the regular pace. Practice nabbing it at exactly the moment!  \\nDark puddles – they are spawned by supernatural enemies – are something of a mixed blessing. They can interfere with your stamina generation but are great for your Anima, so you can Yokai up more easily. Once you have soaked up Yokai benefits, dispel the dark puddle with a Ki Pulse, returning your stamina to normal. \\nThe blacksmithing system allows you to gather enemies fallen gear and transform it into something new and shiny, but this is geared more towards players in higher, harder levels, and can be ignored on your first playthrough, if you want to make rapid progress.   A Word about Weaponry\\nAs expected from a game with a heavy Japanese influence, the weapons are beautifully crafted, diverse and completely, delightfully lethal. You can choose to equip yourself with traditional Japanese weaponry such as kusarigama (sort of ice pick-looking axes, with lengthy chains with which one can get inventively gory) and odachi, (which are basically the Japanese version of a longsword, and traditionally carried by Samurai) right from the character customisation screen.  \\nAs you progress, the game offers a rich melee combat experience, with most of the weapons made to be used up close and very personal. There are some distance weapons, such as bows and arrows, shuriken (stealth weapons, like throwing stars) and rifles, but much of the fun of the game lies in getting close enough to use the close combat weapons which include: axes, tonfas, dual blades, spears, split staffs, hand cannons, switchglaives and katana!  \\nBut we are not yet done with combat: each weapon behaves differently, so you can experiment a bit, and find out which style and which weapons suit you the most. All of the above-named weapons have light and heavy attacks, with light attacks being the ‘regular’ attack you will use most often, only unleashing the heavy attack when faced with the right circumstances. \\nAs well as these more human weapons, you will also have access to special Yokai weapons that are just as lethal as those mentioned above, but with additional mystic powers alongside their sharpness!   Complete Means Complete!\\nThis edition of Nioh 2 is sold as the ‘Complete Edition’ and it lives up to this name, offering the three major issues of DLC (downloadable content) that have been released since the game’s initial offering. And, of course, you get the main game too!   The Tengu’s Disciple Darkness in the Capital The First Samurai\\nAll of which offer new storylines and maps to play through, along with new treasures to seek, missions to complete and allowing further glimpses into the lives and backstories of the characters. The main game offers about forty hours of play time, and the three DLCs offer a further eight to twelve hours each, stacking up to a healthy and immersive game that you can allow yourself to sink into, knowing that you will not be done with it for some time. \\nNioh 2: The Complete Edition for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

The player – that’s you – is a farmer, and your goal is maintaining and growing the farm to make it into a success.  About the Game\\nIn career mode, your first task is always to update the out-dated equipment on the farm, replacing it with newer and better models, as well as expanding the farm. Just as in real life, neglecting any aspect of your farm fares badly for your end results. \\nAs the farmer, you aim to grow crops and breed animals which are then sold for cash. The cash is then used to buy new machines, more animals, fresh seed and expanded buildings. As well as these permanent tasks, there are periodic missions to complete too, which earns a nice cash injection for the farmer. \\nThese side missions include mowing, or delivering cargo. These tasks are time-limited and as well as the cash payment, the farmer can earn a nice bonus for completing the task especially quickly, showing that it pays to be quick and efficient at your tasks. And you have more time in which you can earn even more cash!  \\nMultiplayer, which was introduced in Farming Simulator 2011, is back again and sees the player working for other in-game farmers, performing various tasks like those performed by your AI helpers – without the inconvenience of them getting trapped by an errant tree trunk or fence (which should be a thing of the past, according to the devs!).   What’s New\\nAs with each other new release, the map has expanded, including various new areas in which to farm, new crops to grow and new animals to take care of. This game features two large new map areas to explore and expand your farm into. \\nAs usual too, the game has new vehicles to try out, and continues previously introduced niche aspects of farming, such as forestry. There are also some tricks to try out that boost crop yields such as laying down extra fertiliser, ploughing after a set number of plantings to boost or maintain the fertility of the fields, and using plants like oilseed radishes as protective cover-crops.  \\nLook out for drivable trains, washable cars, and be sure to listen to the in-game radio. As well as the two new maps to explore and cultivate, make sure you pay attention to the weather and the changing seasons as these have an impact on your crop growth. \\nChoose from over 400 machines from 100 different farming brand names – and don’t worry if this sounds intimidating to newcomers, there are plenty of helpful tips and guides for newcomers to the farming world.  \\nExpect to see improvements to AI helpers who, in the last games, tended to get stuck if something blocked their path – nothing like setting your workers to work and coming back later to find them only yards away, trying to walk through a tree! This glitch is, fortunately, mainly a thing of the past. The sound effects in the game are dramatically better too, which adds realism and fun, despite seemingly being a minor detail.  What’s Growing This Year?\\nCrops that can be grown include:  Canola – also known as rapeseed, this plant is a cheerful yellow and produces useful cooking oil Sugarcane – along with sugar beets, sugarcane is one of our main sources of sugar Oats – delicious for humans and racehorses alike, oats are a healthy source of protein Cotton – small white puffs of cotton are spun into cloth fabric, thread and more Corn – chicken feed, popcorn and corn on the cob makes corn a versatile and tasty meal for humans and animals alike Barley – cereal or beer? You decide who you will be selling your crop to! Soybeans – a good source of protein for vegans and vegetarians, soya is one of the most versatile and nourishing foods out there if properly processed Sunflowers – bright, cheerful and favourite of artists everywhere, sunflower seeds are tasty and nourishing, excellent for birds, livestock and people too Horses – racehorses or farm animals, horses can be a great source of income Cattle – dairy and meat – plus calves are super cute!

              " Document(page_content=': 175\\nname: Hell Let Loose\\ndescription: Hell Let Loose for PC is a first-person multiplayer shooter game set during the Second World War. The game specialises in hundred player battles but it is not you against ninety-nine ferocious others. Instead, you are sorted into units of six soldiers each, and all the various units (about eight per side) are divided into two teams.  About the Game\\nThe game map is divided into various sectors, and each unit of six, under the control of a designated leader, must try to capture more of the map than the other team. There are two ways to play: in warfare mode you win by claiming the whole map by beating the other side off every sector, or by possessing more than half of the sectors by the time the timer runs out. \\nIn this game, communication is absolutely key, especially as you are playing with strangers who may or may not decide to obey orders! There are various ways to communicate with proximity mics for yelling at people who are close to you, unit-only mics through which you get your orders and can communicate with your unit leader, as well as network which allows unit leaders to liaise with each other and with their own higher-ups. As well as this, there is a more informal text chat system. \\nThe maps in the game are based on authentic World War Two sites, using a combination of satellite imagery, archival footage, contemporary records and even street level recreations. During gameplay, try to keep an eye on the maps to see where everyone is as the maps are so large that even the fifty people on your side can be spread pretty thin, never mind the six that are supposed to be your immediate companions. \\nAll the weapons and equipment in the game are historically authentic. The developers went to great pains to get it right to give you the best possible game-playing experience.   Get the Best from the Game \\nBecause you are randomly assigned unit-mates, the experience is vastly different each time you play, with good tactical patient leaders showing a very different unit to bully-boys shouting orders and getting in their own way as happens from time to time! Try to stick it out with the bad ones and remember what to do better when you have earned a promotion. \\nAlso, stay in your unit! While you can wander off, if you decide to make your own missions, going off alone will get you killed, most often with a quiet sniper’s bullet taking you out before you even know you’re in danger.  \\nIf the game is not fully packed, or if you are in a quiet area on the map, there will not be many players around, and you can use your senses in a quite realistic way, for example, you can listen out for footsteps or unwary chatter, and dodge out of sight.  \\nBut in more crowded areas – close to the mission goals, for example, or if the game is fully packed, then the warfare is a bit more realistic: loud and confusing! Bombers fly overhead, bullets fly all around and it can sound and feel a bit overwhelming in an overexcited, trying-not-to-die kind of way!  Be All You Can Be\\nThere are various positions open to the eager and obedient soldier. While you all start out as lowly riflemen, it does not take long to earn promotions, and you can begin to specialise into the fourteen career paths, some of which are detailed below:  Medic – race around patching up your fellow soldiers and earning their undying (hopefully) gratitude Engineer – come up with creative solutions to get across wide rivers, repair roads and more Crewman – in it for the camaraderie and banter, be a team player and win through against the enemy Tank Commander – nothing can stand in your way as you direct the tank to where it needs to go Anti-tank – work out how to stop the unstoppable and delight in tipping over tanks, shunting them into rivers or finding new and unusual ways to block their progress Officer – get a taste of being the boss with officer duties. Keep your unit under your command and get them to do what you want them to Scout – if the spying life is for you, then be a scout, creeping over to the other side and checking out what they’re up to. Amongst other things! Sniper – set up ambushes for unwary enemies, and take them out stealthily. Great to undermine their morale! Machine gunner – if mindless gory violence is the cathartic pleasure you need right now, then spraying the opposition with bullets is the job for you\\nHell Let Loose for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

It is the fifth game in the Forza Horizon series, and the twelfth main game from the overall Forza franchise.   About the Game\\nIn this game, you can explore a truly massive open world map, as much as fifty percent larger than Forza Horizon 4’s not inconsiderable map. Race a variety of vehicles through a volcanos’ caldera, explore jungles and rainforests for their hidden ruined cities, spray sand up as you zoom over beaches, as well as racing past waterfalls, snowy mountains, and large reality-based cities like Guanajuato which comes with a network of secret tunnels to explore! \\nMexico is a vast country, and it has amazingly diverse climates depending on where in the country you are, and the game developers have taken pains to give you the full Mexican climate experience in this game! The four seasons behave differently in each of the eleven diverse biomes – and just like in real life, you drive through weather events: getting rained on in the mountain, and then drive out into blazing sunshine in the desert! \\nAll the (many) cars and various playing characters can be extensively customised so you can look exactly the way you want to and drive your dream car too. Play to race against the competition, or just free roam and see what’s out there to be found – all the events pop up to explorers, they just do so in a more random and surprisingly naturalistic manner.   Keep an Eye On…\\nThe games developers not only wanted to recreate the best parts of Mexico onscreen, but they also wanted it to stand up to the minutest scrutiny too, even the tiny elements usually ignored by players. And in this they have been successful, using photogrammetry and ray tracing to create superb graphics that almost demand that you slow down a examine a tree trunk or a rock.  \\nAlong with this, and the beautiful array of diverse cars and out-of-this-world driving experiences, you get to enjoy works of art by genuine Mexican artists and authentic recreations of Mexican landmarks, so realistic that you will think you have visited the real place! Look out for the brand-new Forza concept car which is sure to have motorheads sighing wistfully as well as the usual array of beach buggies, supercars and off-road racers.  What’s New\\nThe game introduces a host of new mini games in the multi-player arena. Let’s see what else is available.  Horizon Arcade: features a series of 12 new minigames for multi-players, such as Pinata pop, in which the Horizon Festival’s plane drops pinatas for you to chase down before everyone else The previous game’s Super 7 has survived and can be found in the Events Lab The game also introduces the Events Lab, where players can create their own custom games and races, tweaking the rules to suit their preferences, and then challenge others to try them out Forza Link is new too, being an AI assistant that tracks the statuses of other players, so you can link with other online players and team up for co-operative play if you like And finally, in Expeditions you can go exploring with a really excited NCP who will tell you what you are looking at, like your very own personal tour guide.

              " Document(page_content=\": 178\\nname: No Man's Sky\\ndescription: No Man’s Sky for PC is an action-adventure survival game in which the player takes the form of a crash-landed alien humanoid who is supplied with the basics of what he or she needs to survive and even thrive. Equipped with a multi-tool, the player can follow the on-screen advice from an entity named Atlas. \\nThis advice leads the players on a pre-set course, giving them plenty of opportunities to mine for resources, battle or trade and team up with fellow players or aliens (the latter are generated by the servers’ algorithms as needed, much like the more distant parts of the cosmos).  \\nBut the best way to play is to head off on your own, building the ships and carriers you need to continue your journey as when you need them. See how far you can travel: trading, mining and fighting as you go.  About the Game\\nWhen released in 2016, the game was hailed as something unique and wonderful, though critics complained because many of the promised features were not present. However, the developers have made good on those promises since that first release and those promised features, such as multi player capability, extra building features, etc, are now available. \\nThe game operates largely using algorithms that ‘create’ the world just ahead of the player’s progress. This is called progression generation and it is a positive because it uses fewer resources than maintaining a fixed world would.  \\nIf players travel to the same place at the same time, they will see the same features and colonies. This makes gameplay more authentic, while keeping the data usage relatively low.  New Details\\nThe developers, a company called Hello Games, have worked hard to bring the game up to its original promise with regular updates that make the game more exciting, immersive and fun for all players. \\nMultiplayer functionality was the main feature that gamers wanted and this was included in the first major update, shortly after the launch. Improved building enables players to make their home base unique to their own preferences: having an ideal home to protect is a good way for players to feel invested in the game.  \\nThe developers continue to release updates regularly so you will always have something new and exciting to look forward to. They have learned from the errors of the past, and now only announce the new features once they are sure that they are player ready.  Ways to Play\\nThe game is predominantly a world-building exploration game, with enough interesting missions to keep interest high. Players can choose their level of difficulty so they can simply explore the beautifully depicted space. There are different methods of play to choose, depending on what the player prefers:  Exploration: The default setting. You take on the character of a crash-landed humanoid alien and set about ensuring your survival and exit from the planet on which you have crash-landed. You are encouraged to use the multi-tool, that all players have as standard, to mine for resources which you then craft into protective gear and transport. Survival: This is similar to standard gameplay but with much higher difficulty so if you like maximum excitement and challenge in your gaming this is the mode for you as you will be subject to more hostile attacks and more combat situations than otherwise. Combat: Full-on battles from the beginning to the end. These usually slot into the player’s exploration, with battles being more prevalent when this mode is chosen. Trading: This mode of play relies more on diplomacy and making deals with the aliens that you come across as you explore the worlds. It is not as easy as it sounds, however, the aliens speak languages which you must work to understand by gathering ‘Rosetta stones’ that will help with translations. Misunderstandings can cause friction! Multiplayer: Up to 16 players can team up to explore new areas of the map and friends can track each other on the map.  Endgame\\nPlay through all the various modes in the format that suits your playing style best, enjoying the beautiful vastness of space and the exquisite landscapes as you travel between planets and settlements to raid, trade and explore the cosmos. \\nNo Man’s Sky for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 179\\nname: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition\\ndescription: Skyrim Special Edition for PC is a remastered version of the highly popular action role-playing game from Bethesda and it represents the fifth edition of the fantasy game. The Skyrim games (the Elder Scroll series) are multi award-winning games known for their open world play, immensely detailed worlds and free-form gameplay that allow the player to drive the action, and to a certain extent, the story.  About the Game \\nAlduin the World Eater is the central antagonist in this game, a massive dragon who is prophesied to end the world. The action takes place in the world of Skyrim, specifically in the northernmost province of Tamriel. The player must work to increase his or her characters strengths and abilities, while working their way across the map.  \\nThere is no urgency to complete the main story arc, so players can explore the whole map and focus on character building before returning to pick up the threads of the storyline and work to defeat Alduin.  What to Do\\nThe player can play from a first-person or third-person perspective, exploring the richly detailed world which includes wilderness areas, towns and cities – both large and small, fortresses and small rural villages. Players can fast travel to cover large distances quickly, or they can ride horses to explore regions fairly quickly but in detail. \\nWhile the storyline can be ignored until the player is ready to continue along that path, some quests do rely on the story having progressed a certain amount, so players might need to dip in and out of narrative play if they want to solve quests in a certain order. \\nYou can, if you want to, race to complete the story arc to ensure that all the areas are unlocked, and then go back and do some explorations. \\nWhichever way you choose to play, the game is highly deserving of many hours’ attention as you explore, quest and battle your way through the intensely detailed land.  The Importance of Being NPC\\nNPCs (non-playing characters) are largely interactive and players can choose to befriend, romance and marry, fight with and even kill them. Some NPCs are important to the storyline and cannot be killed until they have played their part, while others can be killed, but their death then locks some of the content from the player: clues and information that they would have offered the player being inaccessible after their demise. \\nBehaving in an immoral way – killing NPCs etc – can rachet up your infamy, and putting a bounty on your head. Should you be stopped by guards when there is a price on your head, you can be jailed, pay a handsome fine (or bribe) in gold to prevent this, or you can resist arrest, running away and evading the guards.  \\nThis last action will, however, trigger a vigorous pursuit on the part of the guards, and may make life a bit exciting for your character until they can get out of their range.  Three DLCs for You\\nThe Special Edition comes with access to three DLC story arcs, as follows:  Dawnguard: Join or resist the Vampire uprising. Lord Harkon, a vampire lord, wants to use an Elder Scroll to darken the sun, thereby allowing vampires to roam the world freely, at any time, night or day Hearthfire: Perfect for those who love crafting, this DLC lets you build yourself a home, from a basic one-room shack, all the way up to the most sumptuous mansion. Using crafting stations and work benches to your hearts’ content, and then, once your home is ready, adopt some children to make the house into a real home Dragonborn: Travel off the Morrowind to the island of Solstheim where you will meet your deadliest adversary ever: the Dragonborn. The Dragonborn have the body of mortals but the souls of Dragons and they are thought to be the only beings who can defeat Alduin. The fate of the world (and yourself) lies in the outcome of this encounter!\\nSkyrim Special Edition for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 181\\nname: Payday 2\\ndescription: Payday 2 for PC is a co-operative first person shooter game where the success of your play depends quite heavily on your team mates. The game is set in Washington, two years after the events in the first Payday, and is a well-done sequel, which keeps the best of the original game and improves where necessary.   About the Game\\nIn the game, you can choose to plan and conduct heists alone or with up to three teammates. In the course of each operation, you can rob banks, armoured cars, and shops of all types, as well as producing and distributing narcotics. If you like to think outside the box, you can even get into rigging elections or something very niche like stealing and selling smuggled nuclear warheads! \\nCustomise your appearance by first choosing one of the twenty-one gang members on offer and then making whatever cosmetic changes you like. You can make your character much more your own than in the previous incarnation of the game which was quite limited in that area. \\nGunplay is fairly simple, but offers a nicely authentic weightiness, recoil (where your equipment allows), and each weapon sounds different too, giving gunfights a certain satisfying realness. You can almost tell which gun is being used from the sound alone from a high-powered rifle to a beautifully muffled silencer. \\nSkill trees are engaging and make it worthwhile to invest time and effort in improving yourself, as the better your skills, the more fun challenging missions become – and you get more rewards to boot!  Stealthy Does It \\nIn this version, bang-bang shoot-em-ups are frowned upon. The developers have put a lot of work into the stealth mechanics; rewarding for those who like to tiptoe past trouble if they can –and there are plenty of bonus points for the sneakiest players.  \\nDuring gameplay, the excitement is boosted to another level by having the most unexpected things go wrong. Even the best laid plans can be undone by a random civilian walking past at the wrong moment and calling the cops on you, a fire breaking out and triggering an alarm, or some other exciting event needing instant and urgent attention if the plan is to succeed without getting you all locked up!  Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It\\nThere is a randomised bulletin board that pops up from time to time, offering various missions and contracts. If you like the look of it head over to the area of the city where the contract is based and get to work hunting down the target, be it a person, a valuable or something else. If you do not like the look of it, simply ignore it and do your own thing until a mission that does grab your imagination comes along. \\nYou could choose to play in single player mode if you like, but the game is much more fun with real life partners who respond inventively, poorly or amusingly – making the gameplay completely unique each time. As the AI partners in the single player offline mode are lacking in personality and serve only the purpose of protecting you from gunfire, multiplayer will give you a great experience every time!  Choose Your Band Name Difficulty\\nThere is no Easy Mode here. Instead, what we have are seven exotic sounding designations that seem more like a band name than anything else! Taking too many hits and losing too much strength gets you taken into custody: in the lower levels of the game, you are released after a set time has passed, but at the higher levels, you might need a teammate to grab a hostage and bargain to exchange you for them.

              " Document(page_content=': 182\\nname: Mortal Kombat 11\\ndescription: Mortal Combat 11 for PC is a 2.5D fighting game that marks – as the name implies – an impressive twenty-seven years of Mortal Kombat. This not only gives players gives a lot of and back story (especially new players) but it also means the developers have had plenty of practise at making compelling and immersive fighting games. This experience shows! \\n2D is, obviously, flat images having length and breadth. 3D offers depth alongside, whether actual depth, as in real life scenarios, or simulated depth for games and movies. 2.5D is when the illusion of 3D is offered on a 2D platform, or when a game is sometimes 2D with some fully 3D features. This game is the former.  About the game\\nPlayers all start out with the same equipment and form, much of which can then be customised to suit their preferences. The appearance of the avatar has no bearing on the abilities of the character, so a player can bring all their aesthetic tastes to bear without making their avatar weaker or less capable, unlike in some other games. \\nThere is a total of twenty-five playable characters, many with fascinating and compelling back stories, which gives every player plenty of choice when it comes to looks, aggression, defence and so on.  Time Travelling Fun\\nThe main feature of this version of the Mortal Kombat timeline is the time travel element. This is ideal for older players who get a nostalgic glimpse into previous games, while newer players get to see old storylines rewind and work out differently. This fascinating features leads to some very different outcomes – and different outcomes than those desired by the players too!  \\nIn order to earn enough points for upgrades and access to locked areas, players might find that some grinding is necessary. Grinding is repeating tasks or going over old missions in order to gain experience points or other benefits. However, this can be enjoyable, especially repeating easier missions with new powers: old enemies are splattered with joyful ease!  Last Resort Death Knell\\nOne new modification in this game is the introduction of Fatal Blows. These are not available all the time, only being usable once your health level as dropped to dangerous lows. They are a sort of last resort, a final flourish to attempt to get your opponent before he or she finishes you off. \\nThe offence and defence metres are now separate, so you can boost your offence to make an attack particularly strong or you can boost defence for cunning roll-escapes or counterattacks without using up too much power. Tutorials will quickly and easily talk you through using these new features, and you’ll be fighting your way to success in no time.  Ways to play Story Mode\\nAs mentioned above, the back story for MK is now a long and complicated saga worthy of publication as a standalone book or movie. Play through the game, until you achieve one of the two official endings – or go off canon and make up your own ending!   Combat mode\\nBlood splashes everywhere as you just enjoy the sickening but inventive ways to paint the gore around, taking out everyone you see. Explore the open map to find targets or follow the on-screen instructions, just taking your own blood-thirsty time about it!   Krypt mode\\nThis is more of a sub-game than a mode, and can save you some of the above-mentioned grinding. Plunder the island for treasure and other loot, smashing down walls and opening chests to retrieve gold and other valuables, which can then be used to buy customised skins, weapons and gears, secret entrances and even to modify AI behaviour in your own favour.  \\nMortal Combat 11 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

As the title strongly ‘hints’ it is set in medieval times, shortly after 1346 when a terrible plague swept through the land. It is your job to build a fortress and keep your villagers happy and healthy.  About the Game\\nFollowing the 1346 plague – the Black Death (which was a bubonic plague that caused hideous black-purple swellings, or buboes, in the lymph nodes, making it seem as though sufferers had turned black, hence the name) has decimated the world’s population, taking out around ninety-five percent of the people. You, as one of the few survivors, along with some companions must try to re-establish civilisation, the best way you can. \\nYou are given a few companions, usually three, with which to start your settlement, and one of your first tasks will be to build a multi-story fort – see more about this below – to defend yourself and your people from the various threats out there. However, you cannot just go ahead and build in stone. You have to work your way up from a small wooden shack and earn your way to stone-worked magnificence!   The Nitty Gritty\\nAs well as building your fortress, it is up to you and your small band to try and repopulate society too. To achieve these ends you must find the balance between the hostile environment, your people’s survival and careful resource management and deployment. Position archers and make traps to reinforce your fences and strongholds, just in case your enemies have a particularly sneaky bent!  \\nAs well as disease having ravaged the population, a famine has wiped out a lot of the crops that would otherwise be available, and there are also religious groups who want to either capture or convert you – or perhaps send you onwards to the great beyond! But don’t just blindly take out anyone you see staggering up to your gate, there are also other survivors who pop up from time to time, joining your village and making themselves useful. \\nAs well as the two religious factions, there are other settlements on the map, and you are delayed in achieving your aims by the incursions of wolves and bandits, which quickly make you realise the importance of sturdy fences! As well as building along, this game allows you to build up, putting several stories onto your buildings, and you can also dig down, laying down cellars and basements.   Keep ’Em Happy!\\nYour villagers are moody little creatures – all of them have back stories and different motivations for their various actions, so you will have to get to know them individually, as well as providing the four basic things that a happy healthy villager needs before their individual quirks set them off! Each villager must be given a series of priorities for their day, up to four, that will keep them occupied and entertained.  Food: you must ensure that not only does each villager have enough to eat, but you must remind them to actually eat by setting a priority for this to happen, along with the other tasks you set for them Sleep: like food, villagers need sleep to keep them healthy and sane, and they will need this set as one of their priorities to keep them in good condition Safety: no one enjoys eating or sleeping under threat, so you should build your fortress with care so none of the threats mentioned above can sneak in and do away with your villagers. As well as a sturdy fence keeping bad ’uns out, each house should be sturdy too Comfort: who doesn’t like a little comfort? No one that’s who, and your characters are no different. Make allowances for the odd home comforts – an extra blanket, a new pillow etc, and they will reward you by being happy and productive\\nGoing Medieval for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Featuring third person play, you take on the character of web-lord, Spider-Man, dealing with Peter Parker’s personal life as well as battling super-human villain Mister Negative – a villain’s name if there ever was one! – in his bid to take over New York’s underworld.  About the Game\\nMister Negative plans to achieve his aims by unleashing a deadly virus on the city – a chilling forecast of Covid-19, perhaps. Spider-Man must jump, run, swing and use his webs to navigate the Manhattan borough in the fictionalised NYC, aiming webs precisely to achieve your goals. When Spidey is in too much of a hurry to swing, you can use fast travel by hopping on the subway. \\nThe physics engine is great, allowing you to jump, swing, run and generally navigate around with a realistic, if somewhat superhuman – jumping higher, landing lighter etc – environment to play through. Popular already, the new game is still a solid play now improved and with four levels of difficulty to try out: Friendly, Amazing, Spectacular and the latterly introduced Ultimate corresponding to easy, medium, hard and challenging, respectively. \\nThere is also a new mode: ‘New Game Plus,’ mode which allows you to start the game from scratch, but with all the suits and gadgets already unlocked so you can play more freely using all the gadgets and gizmos that you shouldn’t really have access to in the early stages.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game has a lovely open world feel, with Spider-Man able to freely explore the city. He can also accept side quests, interact with NPCs, complete missions and earn tokens, which are the in-game currency which allows you to buy goodies, and unlock new suits and useful gadgets (such as electric webbing, impact webbing which pushes enemies away and makes them stick to whatever they bump into, concussive blast). \\nAs you play along and progress through the game’s story arc, there are also collectibles to snatch up and additional content to unlock. As might be expected from a Spider-Man game, combat mainly involves web-slinging, using the environment to your best advantage and chaining attacks together to befuddle enemies rather than take them down in face-to-face combat.   What Do You Get with the Remastered Edition?\\nThe remastered game comes with many improvements, which include:  You get the original game, of course, but with all the latest graphics and physics engine improvements of the last four years You get all the free DLC that was released after the game’s release You get all the previously paid for DLC, mainly the three episodes of The City Never Sleeps Three new spidey suits to try out: one from The Amazing Spider-Man film of 2012, plus two made by the game’s developers, namely The Arachnid Rider suit and the Armoured Advance suit There are plenty of new trophies to win Extras in photo mode Two new suits from the 2021 Spider-Man: No Way Home movie Subtle adjustments have been made to Spider-Man’s face, making him more responsive and expressive, thanks to mo-cap advances\\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Bannerlord shifts the action to an even earlier timeframe, the Migration Period that ran between 375AD to 586AD, some two hundred years before the events of the previous games.  About the Game\\nThe game is a cheerful and immersive melding of sandbox action, role-playing, and strategy games, the whole adding up to an immersive and exciting experience as you build up your mighty dynasty from humble and lowly beginnings. You can play campaign mode as a single player, or you can take your army online and play against other online players. \\nDialogue engines have been dramatically improved, and along with this comes more realistic and engaging interactions between players and NPCs (non playing characters), many of whom need to be persuaded into courses of action that they are initially unwilling to follow. There is a progress bar to indicate to the player how well their offers are going down: if this bar is not filled with charm alone, they can switch to bartering to get the NPC to go along with them. \\nThe strategic part of the game comes into play early on, with the player needing to examine the terrain, look for weaknesses in the opposition’s defences.  \\nTo speed up gameplay and move the action along, only certain parts of the fortresses (merlons, gatehouses and siege engines) are destroyable, so weapons should be placed with care, aiming to destroy those parts belonging to the enemy, while protecting your own siege engines to keep the damage flowing.  Weapon Classes and How to Use Them\\nIn the game, soldiers are ranked based upon their class, being put into one of three categories:  Infantry: Most usually aligned with pawns, infantrymen tend to be thought of as foot soldiers, moving at a walking pace for much of the time, and obediently doing as they are told. But well-trained infantrymen can form an immovable barrier, preventing an enemy force from moving across the land, and ensuring that fortifications or valuable assets are well-protected. Of course, this takes training and patience – and often, good leadership too.  Ranged: The term ‘ranged weapons’ refers to those that can be used outside of close combat or hand to hand fighting. While today, a machine gun nest would be a perfect example of a ranged weapon – a weapon that works over a long range – in the times at which the game is set, the ranged weapons would have been serried ranks of archers, unleashing flight after flight of arrows, which could momentarily darken the sky when expert archers were at work!   Cavalry: Usually the posh guys on horses, encouraging the poorer soldiers to run ahead and sacrifice themselves for the cause, cavalrymen were the most mobile soldiers on the field, often having an excellent view from their lofty position, and able to move quickly, jumping over obstacles and moving three or four times faster than a person, cavalrymen could engage with the enemy, break off, and then return to the fray with renewed vigour to finish off the enemies.  \\nMount and Blade II: Bannerlord for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/761/pcover/761.jpg?v=1697644479', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 190}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=': 191\\nname: Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\\ndescription: Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales for PC is the 2020 console game remastered for PC. It is an action adventure game based on the decade-long graphic work which culminated in the 2018 animation film, Spiderman into the Spiderverse.   About the Game\\nThe game picks up after the events of the movie, continuing Miles Morales adventures as he learns to juggle civilian life verse superheroing. It is not long before he discovers that his new home in Harlem is threatened by a battle between the tech giant, Roxxon Energy Co, and the latest villainous crew, the Underground, led by mysterious villain, The Tinkerer. \\nAs Miles does his best, he keeps an eye on the city’s doings by using an app which tells him what crimes are ongoing as well as alerting him to news and side missions. Like Peter, Miles possesses a \"spider-sense\", which warns the player of incoming attacks and allows them to dodge and retaliate. \\nHe also has, of course, web-shooters, which stream webs that can be used during both traversal and combat, in several different ways. Miles can also jump, stick to surfaces, and fast travel using the New York City subway system. \\nIt’s not all web slinging and flying high over the city though. During certain sections of the game, players control Miles in his civilian persona and cannot use any of his abilities or gadgets. Miles does his best to help Spiderman, but his confidence is quite low after a couple of fairly high-level mistakes, so when Spidey lets him know that he, Spidey will be out of town for a bit, with MJ, Miles is convinced it’s all going to go wrong.   The Nitty Gritty\\nThe third person perspective lends itself well to the main focus of the game and, as always with Spidey games, this translates to Miles’ movements and combat positions. Combat allows you to link attacks together, and use the environment and webs to take down villains while avoiding as much damage as you can. \\nSide-missions have been significantly altered, and are now accessed from an in-game phone app (mentioned above). Miles has several unlockable suits, some of which are based on existing versions of the character in media, as well as original suits created just for the game. Many of these enhance Miles\\' abilities, such as allowing him to take less damage, stay invisible for a longer time, or regenerate Venom Power faster. \\nThe game’s graphics are beautiful, with gorgeous sights to enjoy from the top of buildings or as Miles swings along to get where he’s going, so do remember to – occasionally – slow down and enjoy the view.\\nThroughout the game Miles can treat fictional Manhattan, NY as something of an open world sandbox, albeit a snowy one as the game is set during the holidays, interacting with other characters and gathering useful tools and gadgets, completing missions and side questions, and, of course, unlocking those new suits.   New Powers Just for Miles\\nNew powers and gadgets, unique to Miles in this game are:  Venom Blast, which allows the player to incapacitate enemies with bioelectricity, and charge or drain electronics Camouflage, which gives Miles temporary invisibility Mega Venom Blast, consisting of a massive explosion of bioelectricity that damages all nearby enemies Remote Mines, which can attach to enemies or electrical panels; a device that summons holographic fighters to help in combat Gravity Wells that trap multiple enemies and make them easier to hit\\nAll Miles’ powers can be upgraded through a skill tree.\\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 192\\nname: Human: Fall Flat\\ndescription: Human: Fall Flat for PC is a platform puzzle game that is perfect for those with a quirky sense of humour and a knack for seeing things a little differently. The animations are comedic even as the puzzles can be fiendish and you will spend hours alternately chuckling at your character’s antics or cursing as you try to work out how to solve the current puzzle.  About the Game\\nYou control a shapeless humanoid figure called Bob – they are all called Bob! – as you work your way around the game. Each level consists of getting Bob to the exit where he enters the next level and does it all over again. \\nBob has no special powers he is all human, and must navigate around the levels in a very human fashion: no flying, no death-defying leaps or gravity defying gliding to avoid larger than usual gaps. \\nInstead, Bob must use what is around the landscape to enable him to climb, jump and otherwise get around the obstacles in his way. Various secrets are hidden that offer tutorials on how to tackle new challenges: these can include stacking boxes, learning to climb up walls, navigate ledges and even how to make walls crumble so you can get through to the other side.  Customising Bob\\nBob is something of a blob at first, vaguely humanoid but featureless and sporting only a baseball cap which is sort of built into his general shape. However, playing co-op mode or multiplayer doesn’t have to be confusing, each player can customise Bob their own way.  \\nBob can be dressed in a variety of clothing – you can even get your fellow players to emulate the Village People if you want to! – or you can dress him in any way you choose.  \\nOr Bob can stay naked! You can paint his skin any colour you like, including stripes, polka dots or a smiley face. You can put war-stripes on him, or just paint his cap: the Paint style customisation tool lets you do your own thing with your Bob.  Ways to Play Single Player – Potentially the most difficult way to play, you have to take Bob through the puzzles by yourself, working out solutions, fetching and moving objects that will help you and plugging away at tricky manoeuvres until you have mastered them well enough to get to the end of the level Co-op Mode – Your Bob and your friend’s Bob can work together to puzzle out how to get to the exit in the quickest and safest manner, as you enjoy watching their antics and help each other out. Bob’s death-grip works on other Bobs, so if one of you has mastered a particular climb or swing, just have the other one grab hold and be carried safely across Multiplayer Mode – Up to eight of you can work to solve puzzles as a group. The word group fits better than ‘team’ as some of the other players can work against the others, throwing away boxes needed for climbing, selfishly using ropes needed by all of you, or doing other mildly annoying things of that ilk. Mildly annoying as items tend to respawn or be plentiful, and there are usually multiple ways to get to a solution Pro Tip: In co-op mode and multiplayer mode, your Bob can hang onto other players to swing across or to be piggybacked up a climbing wall. In this game, multiplayer is definitely more fun – the more Bobs there are slapping sticky hands onto walls, splatting down cliffs and puzzling their marshmallow heads over solutions, the more enjoyment there is to be had by all\\nHuman: Fall Flat for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 194\\nname: Resident Evil 3\\ndescription: includes Resident Evil Resistance, a new 1 vs 4 online multiplayer game set in the Resident Evil universe where four survivors face-off against a sinister Mastermind. \\nResident Evil 3 for PC is a follow-on from the remake of the previous Resident Evil 2, and a remake of the original 1999 game.  \\nThis remake looks to be just as popular as the previous one, the developers having chosen exactly the right features when choosing which to improve and which to leave alone. There is even more action than Resident Evil 2, as per customer feedback, although the game developers have not made this game as shiny slick and reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster as Resident Evil 6 – which is a good thing.  About the Game\\nAgainst the backdrop of a lethal ‘cannibal virus’ which seems to be transforming citizens into zombies, Jill Valentine and her colleagues in the police are trying to uncover the full extent of the nefarious doings of the evil Umbrella Corp. Carlos Oliveira is also back, the rough-looking mercenary also looking into Umbrella Corp’s actions and motivations for his own reasons. Their semi-uneasy truce adds spice to the game: can she trust him fully or should she hold back a bit? Only playing through will tell!  \\nThere are more open spaces than the rather restricted confines of Resident Evil 2, and this game gives players decent views of and around Racoon City which is rather lovely, even as it is also rather conflicted. Shops, sewers and subways are all explorable, and sharp-eyed players will spot immovable yellow padlocks in some places. Once Jill has learned one or two rather specific skills, she can return to these areas to see what is hidden behind them  New Way to Play\\nEach purchase of the game comes with a copy of Resident Evil Resistance – which is a new, seemingly unbalanced 1 versus 4 game. There is one Mastermind against four survivors all playing across one limited map.  \\nThe survivors aim to keep that appellation (i.e., survive!), while the mastermind is more of a distant overlord, placing traps and enemies and not actively engaging with the survivors. The Mastermind needs to play something of a chess game, anticipating the survivors’ movements, while they should behave as though everything is a trap!  Amazing Improvements\\nThe character imagery is vastly improved for both Jill and Carlos. The characters’ clothing and body shapes are slightly less clichéd, and the graphics are immensely improved with the action looking quite like real filmed footage rather than computer rendered action. Jill and Carlos both look very realistic, almost as though they have been photographed rather than drawn. \\nThis humanising effect however, doesn’t translate to Nemesis, the arch enemy, although he too has been improved, tweaked and modified! He is bigger and badder than ever, with awe-inspiring bulk and red-hot rage displayed in the tension of his massive shoulders, the clench of huge Thanos-like fists, and his many and sneaky ways to track you down!  New Move! For this game you can now dodge away from a zombie, should it manage to sneak up to you and get closer than is comfortable.  If you time your dodge just right it will give you enough time to grab your gun and sort out the zombie, or run away if you are not looking a fight right now!  If a zombie does manage to lay its foul hands on you all is not lost – button mashing (pressing all the buttons simultaneously) can sometimes shake them off and give you precious moments to make your escape! \\nResident Evil 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 201\\nname: Dying Light 2 Stay Human\\ndescription: Dying Light 2 for PC is a survival horror action role playing game (RPG) for single players and cooperative multi players. The game is a direct follow on from the first in the series, Dying Light, in which protagonist Kyle Crane ventures into a zombie filled quarantine zone, using combat and parkour to both defeat them and escape from them. This sequel has a new protagonist, Aiden Caldwell, and is set fifteen years later, in the same city as before.     About the Game\\nParkour is still very much a feature, as is the combat, and Aiden Caldwell has a great deal of new tech to help him with his tasks. The parkour is, in fact, vastly improved, with up to twice as many new moves as before. Aiden’s movement about the city are further aided with the addition of a grappling hook so he can get up those highest buildings and a paraglider for speedy and zombie free lateral movements. \\nAnd lateral movement is more important in this game, with much more of the city forming Aiden’s playground. The map in this sequel is four times the size of the not-inconsiderable game play area of the original game, and all of it is open range sand-box style, so you can explore everywhere and discover all sorts of fun hidden spaces which may or may not contain loot or other treasures that will make your character’s life a little easier. \\nThe map is broken up into seven distinct zones, and each area has its own unique landmarks and features. Interacting with non-playing characters (called NPCs) and the factions to which they belong can have huge implications deeper into the game, so think all your movements and actions through with some care before you act: you do not want an unwary slip in the opening hours of play to come back to bite you just as you are getting close to the end scenes!   Ways to Beat the Zombies Parkour: Stylish moves, part dance, part urban performance art, park combat. Your character will use the urban features around him to move above, below or beside the zombie hordes, occasionally needing to use his skills to break free of them should a pack surround him a bit too closely for comfort! \\nWith plenty of old moves as well as all the new ones to learn, invest some time and effort in getting to grips with this skill – you never know when it will save your butt! Melee Weapons: Designed for up close and personal use, melee weapons are the most frequently used in this up close and personal game. However, make sure you keep an eye on your weapons as these ones degrade as you use them and your handy dagger might suddenly fall to pieces just as you are about to administer the coup de grace! Long Range Weapons: Spears, crossbows and even shotguns are easier to maintain. Being distance weapons they do not suffer the same damage as the melee weapons, and they can kill enemies from a safe distance so your own health points remain in good condition. Sunlight: Daytime makes the zombies confused and sleepy so make sure you plan your most serious engagements for bright sunlit hours. Avoid engaging with the zombies in the dark as this is when they are their most powerful and their most blood (or brain) thirsty. \\nDying Light 2 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

About the Game\\nCovering a wide swathe of Europe and the UK, the map stretches from Aberdeen to Milan, from Plymouth to Wrocraw, and it is your job to cover as much of the map as possible in order to thoroughly explore the sand-box-style game. The map keeps track of your travels and it can take up to 160 hours to fully explore every last inch of the road. \\nWhile you can explore freely, you are given quests and missions to complete in order to stay on the road and in good driving condition. The game is loosely based on the economics of a delivery driver, and the lure of cold hard cash will get you out of bed and onto the road.  What’s the Story?\\nStart off small, as a delivery driver for someone else, and slowly work your way up until you have enough cash to be your own boss. This process can be sped up by going to your back and getting a fat loan to buy everything you need to hit the big time right away. \\nGradually you can work your way up to being the boss of a large delivery fleet with multiple trucks and drivers under your employ  What’s New?\\nThe physics engine is superb and your brain will be fooled into thinking that you are actually driving, even as the bumps and ruts on the road seem to travel through your very seat!  \\nThe scenery is fantastic, if slightly fictionalised, with plenty of variety both on and off the road. You have to stay sharp to keep an eye on other traffic, while the road turns and bends unexpectedly and yet accurately. Do not expect to see your favourite corner or roundabout though, the game does take some liberties with real life. But unless you live in that exact area, it is unlikely that you – or anyone else – will become too distressed with this breach!  Custom Paint Job\\nSince the game’s release there have been a number of upgrades and expansion pack, some of which include being able to customise the look of your vehicle. This can be a permanent paint job, or you can dress your truck up temporarily: for Halloween or Christmas or any other special occasion. \\nBeing able to give your truck a unique look really helps you to engage with the game and makes you feel invested in doing you best at all the missions and challenges. Plus it’s fun!  Truck Models to Choose\\nThere are a number of types of truck that the players can choose between:  DAF: Originally styled DAV until the licence came through, there are two types of DAF truck to choose from in the game. Either truck will work well for players who are fans of the massive vehicles Mercedes-Benz: (Majestic until the licencing issues were sorted). The game features five different Mercedes’ vehicles, of which two are AI cars, one is a dump truck and the remaining two are drivable trucks. Perfect for those who love Mercedes’ smooth rides and effortless power Iveco: (Ivedo) Choose between two horses to get your deliveries where they need to go. There is also a cargo truck (which can be either a piece of cargo or an AI vehicle on the road)  Volvo : (Valiant) Volvo seems to predominate with five vehicles spread between being drivable trucks, cargo items or AI vehicles. The companies trademark solidity and safety translate well to the small screen Scania: Four of these well-known trucks are available for you to choose, with at least two of them doubling as cargo items Renault: Two trucks and six AI vehicles or cargo items make up the French car manufacturer’s contribution to the game MAN: Two drivable trucks give you a solid driving choice that will get you there and back without any stress or issues\\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 209\\nname: Escape from Tarkov\\ndescription: Escape from Tarkov is a tactical first-person shooter set in the fictional Norvinsk region of Russia, around a transition zone between Russia and Europe that serves as a gateway for trade and deals. However, the temptation has proven too much for villainous organisations looking to cash in any way they can and the area has erupted into a tense standoff between Russian forces, UN Peacekeepers and two independent PMCs (Private Military Companies). \\nThese are: United Security (known as USEC) and BEAR. USEC was hired by the corrupt organisation Terra which was responsible for much of the turmoil, while BEAR are their opposition, hired by the Russian authorities to investigate Terra and their nefarious doings.  About the Game \\nThe premise is very simple: entering the game has your character spawning in the forest or somewhere similar, on the edge of the map. Your job is to shoot, play and explore your way across the map until you reach your extraction point, usually way over on the other side of the city, and with plenty of excitement in between you and there! \\nAt first, you are only armed with an axe, and you must quickly defeat someone else for their loot (unlikely if they have a gun and you don’t) or get exploring and find a working gun as soon as possible.  \\nThere is no heads-up display for this game: if you want to check your inventory, you have to do it manually, for example, counting the bullets left inside your gun. Oddly, this makes it more exciting as you become hyper aware of what you have with you at all times and counting down your shots in the middle of a battle makes you exquisitely aware of every danger lurking just around every corner.   Lots of Lovely Loot: But Choose with Care!\\nThe ground is practically littered with valuable loot, from mobile phones to cigarettes to cash and even weapons, and it’s all there for the players to help themselves. However, be wary about what you pick up: it’s all valuable stuff, but the longer you are picking over the buildings and neighbourhoods, the longer it will take for you to get to your extraction point.  \\nIt also gives other players a good chance of stumbling across you and taking you out – which automatically causes you to lose all your hard-gathered items! It is best to load up with as many high value items as you can gather in a minute or two, and then be on your way as fast as possible. \\nOf course, you can always linger for a while, tempting other players in to gather loot and then taking them out while they head for your bait: this way, you get their loot to add to your own. A couple of high-value skirmishes could garner you more loot than you would have been able to collect in four times the time!  Arm Up\\nWeapons range from the basic and almost primitive to high-end tactical gear:  Axes – you start with these Knives – a good way to sneak up on enemies and kill silently, without alerting their comrades Handguns and Shotguns – low end guns, these will keep you handily ahead of the enemy, unless they have bigger better guns Rifles – high-powered, scoped weapons that enable players to snipe you from afar. Getting your hands on one of these is a blessing and a curse: you are powerful, but you attract a lot of envious attention\\nEscape from Tarkov is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

This game is the fifth game in the overall Life is Strange series, being the third main game, and the direct successor to Life is Strange 2.   About the Game\\nIn this game, 21-year-old Alex Chen, an American Asian who has just aged out of the foster care system. Her first action is to get in touch with her brother Gabe, with whom she has lost touch over the preceding eight years, when he aged out of the system. After that initial contact, Alex sets off for beautiful small town, Haven Springs, to reconnect with him. \\nHowever, unfortunately, things go wrong and Gabe is killed in a tragic and mysterious accident. Alex’s task, therefore, is to uncover the mystery behind her brother’s death. She is aided in her task by the fact – recently discovered – that she is an empath (which is less mind reading and more heart reading, sensing emotions rather than picking out details) who can pick up on the emotions of others. \\nPlaying as Alex, you will explore the setting of Haven Springs (see below for some specific places to look out for) and communicate with the NPCs (Non-playing characters) who follow pre-set dialogue trees. Alex can see their emotions – they appear as colourful auras – and if the emotion is intense enough, it can infect Alex too, causing her to feel that same emotion.  \\nAs well as experiencing and sensing the emotions felt by others, Alex learns to both absorb and manipulate the strong emotions felt by others to help her in her mission. In order to find the truth about Gabe, Alex must help the townsfolk (the NPCs) process their own traumas so that they will then be able to help her solve the mystery of Gabe’s ‘accident’. Characters from other Life is Strange games, Ralph and Steph, appear in this one as potential love rivals for Alex’s affections.   The Nitty Gritty\\nGiven the importance of emotion to the game, it comes as no real surprise that the motion capture (mocap) is world class, with detailed and accurate emotional readings from the actors caught in minute detail, so that even the most oblivious player will be able to spot shifts in mood without seeing the brightly coloured auras!  \\nThere are some extra clothes, so you can change Alex’s outfit, and a Steph-centric sub-story called Wavelengths. Unlike in previous versions of the game, you get the whole game, including sub plots, immediately, no hanging around waiting for the cliff-hanger to be undone and the moment of crisis past.  \\nHowever, the player must use finesse and subtlety in playing. People often say one thing while meaning quite another, so Alex must use her empath powers to understand what the person is feeling, despite what they are saying. If she gets if wrong, Alex will not get the answers that she (and the NPCs) needs in order to achieve understanding and closure.  Where to Go?\\nAlex arrives in Haven Springs with no idea of who to trust – or even who to speak to! She sets off to explore, and amongst other places, she will come across:   Radio Station – this place is the cultural heart of the Haven Springs – Steph Gringrich (mentioned above) is the DJ, adding a bit of intriguing spice to Alex’s already exciting life!  Record Store – attached to the Radio Station, and, in fact, offering an excellent view of the DJ doing her thing, the record store is a great place to browse and mentally chill out for a bit Bar – offering music, foosball and other arcade games, and the chance to enjoy a drink with a talkative NPC – or alone – Alex can spend some thoughtful downtime in the bar, seeing the auras of the people passing by Ice Cream Shop – who doesn’t like ice cream?\\nLife is Strange: True Colours for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 223\\nname: Planet Coaster\\ndescription: Planet Coaster for PC is an amusement park construction and management simulation game which is the spiritual successor to RollerCoaster Tycoon 3  About the Game\\nThe graphics style is charmingly cartoonish which adds to the fun, and the 3D gameplay is great for when you test out your own, newly created, rollercoaster rides. But do not let the cheerful and childlike animations fool you: the spreadsheets on the management side are tight, well-plotted and concise, allowing you to see exactly where your money is going and, more importantly, where it is coming from so you can make even more! \\nWithin the game you have a lot of control, even in the more challenging modes when resources are restricted. You can even pick the font that is used on your park signs, so you really can plan out and place your amusement park exactly the way you want it.  Manage Everything!\\nThe management part of the game is fairly intense and while it starts out easy – paying one mechanic and one janitor to fix one ride and clean the small park is a doddle. When you have so many employees that you start to lose track of them all, then it becomes a little more hair-raising. \\nRides must be maintained to prevent queues and customer dissatisfaction, janitors must sweep and clean (and you have to provide a good number of bins around the park to keep them happy!), research and development must be ongoing so customers keep coming back, and you also have to keep an eye on your profits, balancing your desire for fat bank accounts with good staff morale and happy customers to keep the lucre rolling in!  Three Ways to Play Sandbox: This is the creative bit, where you have unlimited resources and access to all the surrounding land. You can design the most sumptuous and exciting rides for others to enjoy, and you can enjoy them yourself – all in the name of testing only, of course! Some players much prefer this mode of play, taking their time and using the best possible materials to make enthralling and exciting rides – or recreating real life ones that they have seen for themselves Challenge: Perhaps the most exciting way to play. You start off with a small amount of land and money, and must invest all your ingenuity and skill into turning that into profit to buy more land and build more rides. As you go along, you will be issued with challenges, the successful completion of which will bring you rewards, such as resources, cash or pieces on land on which you can build even more rides, facilities and features Career: In this mode the goal is for you to make as much money as possible, maximising the use of your existing funds to build rides that will bring in the customers and keep them in the park, happily spending their money for as long as possible. You must balance your profits against the needs of the park and customers, fighting to keep everyone happy and pouring their currency into your pocket, while paying staff and maintaining the park well\\nIn all three modes, you are able to use auto-finish on rides, which means that instead of agonising over angles and speeds and precise measurements, you can plot in your exciting twists and turns, your beginning and your end, and then let the computer plot the bits of track in between, presenting you with a fully completed and functioning ride. \\nPlanet Coaster for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/885/pcover/885.jpg?v=1704792837', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 223}),\n",
              " Document(page_content=': 224\\nname: Conan Exiles\\ndescription: Conan Exiles is a survival game based on the popular cult hero, Conan the Barbarian, who plays a small but significant part in the game’s beginning.  About the Game \\nThe game begins with the playable character being rescued by the eponymous hero, Conan. The character has been found guilty of a crime and crucified and left to die next to an abandoned and derelict road. Conan cuts you loose and then vanishes, having played his part in your life! \\nThe game is set in the mythical Hyborian times from the book series of the same name. Players must work their way along the evolutionary arc moving from wood to stone to iron to steel tools and equipment all in a matter of mere hours. \\nInstead of tutorials, the player has journals which spell out a suggested learning curve, talking you through gathering materials, finding food and water – your health metre is fairly fragile during the first few levels after your rescue and must be watched carefully until you have enough possessions that it maintains itself, more or less. \\nThere is a truly impressive crafting skill tree to work through too, and the rare materials needed for the more exotic, high end items are sure to have you donning your armour and grabbing your sword (or weapon of choice) and heading off to distant and unexplored bits of the map in search of them. \\nSome of the items need an awful lot of work to produce: suits of armour, for instance, require a lot of material and three different crafting stations before you are even close to thinking about suiting up. But they are worth it: the sense of pride when you put on your armour and survive encounters with ease that would have killed you: victory! \\nA later upgrade introduced pets to the game, so you never need to be alone again. Raise your pet from a cub or egg, keeping it safe and fed and it will grow into a faithful and loyal companion, regularly producing poop that you can use as fertiliser.  Desert, Tundra or Mountains?\\nThere are three types of terrain, called biomes in which your character can explore, hunt, build and survive. They are as follows:  Desert: the original Exiled Lands to which the player has been banished, with every possibility of sudden unpleasant death around every dune. Tundra: The Frozen North offers new building materials and is a source of Star Metal, a rare substance that makes strong armour and better weapons. It also offers terrible weather and lethal storms, so make sure you’re prepared for bad weather! The Highlands: a pleasant green and hilly region that tends to be well-populated, both with people (who may be hostile) and creatures (who will almost certainly be hostile!). Volcano: Surprisingly well populated for a place of lethal heat, the volcano is home to creatures such as Living Magma and various Serpentmen, as well as hosting a plethora of treasure-containing ruins and fallen temples. Survive by using heat-resistant armour and taking along plenty of ice and water to keep your cool.  Ways to Play Single player: make your way in the world: building, hunting and defending yourself. Playing this way is surprisingly reminiscent of Minecraft with its huge amount of creative freedom.  Tethered Co-op with a buddy: you and a friend can work together to explore the map, puzzle out hidden clues and journey to far off distant places. Work is a little easier with two of you and battles more intense. Having a companion along makes the game even more fun Multiplayer – strangers can destroy all your work just for fun. When you’re offline you should be safe from attack, but other players don’t always play by the rules, especially if you join someone’s private server. Limited to forty players per server \\nHowever you decide to play, keep your eyes peeled for the hidden storyline: a series of subtle markers and occasionally friendly NPCs that will guide you towards a mystery tale: something to add even more intrigue to an absorbing game. \\nConan Exiles is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=\": 233\\nname: F1 22\\ndescription: F1 22 for PC is the twenty-third, and rumoured to be the last, in the franchise of the beloved licenced racing game. Join drivers and cars from all over the world in competing on some of the best loved race tracks in the world. It seems the game will return in some form, but without the official F1 licensing, but at this stage, details are sketchy.  About the Game\\nOne of the main new additions in F1 22 is the new F1 Life mode. You step straight into the glamorous world of Formula 1 with F1Life, which is a customisable hub where you can show off your collection of supercars, clothing, and accessories, and any rewards you’ve earned via gameplay.  \\nFor the first time ever, cross play is available, so you can play with your buddies on Xbox, PlayStation or PC all at the same time.  \\nThe cars alone are well worth investing in this game, thanks to a sweeping new set of regulations which have changed the way the cars look, feel and move. Shorter and narrower than the previous models, these cars also have simplified aerodynamics, wheel hubs, and front-wheel covers. They will be different to drive too, with less downforce on the slower corners but more in faster corners thanks to the new ground effects.  \\nAlong with the new Pirelli tyres, players can look forward to new, real-life, tracks from Australia, Spain, Miami and more. In addition, there's a new 'Immersive' mode that will involve long-time players in more aspects of Race Day including managing the safety car procedures, nailing pit stops, and avoiding embarrassments like crashing on the formation lap before the race has even begun! \\nPerhaps most intriguingly, F1 22 aims to give you a taste of the glamorous F1 driver lifestyle off the track as well as on it. A new F1 Life 'hub' area will apparently be completely customisable to your tastes and team affiliation, allowing you to show off clothing, accessories and supercars accumulated as you play.   The Nitty Gritty\\nSingle player is, as always, superb, and F1 22's Career Mode boasts 'new features' with new adaptive AI which are ‘tailored to match the skill level’ of the player for a seamless, challenging but frustration free race. \\nFor the first time in the F1 game's history, Sprint Races have made an appearance in the F1 mode! This means you'll be able to compete in Sprint Races in both F2 and F1 in the game. As well as this, lot more customisation is available, especially in career mode and there is also broadcast mode and immersive mode. Being in the driving seat is more than a metaphor with all these customisable features and inclusions \\nOf course, you’ll be competing in the races in new hybrid cars, alongside new race types, and more competitive line-ups. But there is plenty for everyone, whether they are old hands or newcomers to the game. For instance, F1 22 introduces a new adaptive AI that keeps players of all skill competitive. Enhancements to mechanics, such as My Team, bring fresh changes.  \\nThe game supports PC virtual reality headsets, so you can experience the thrill and violent nausea of hurtling around a racetrack at triple-digit cornering speeds. Just try not to be sick on your expensive gaming PC! (Of course, always follow manufacturer guidelines when it comes to using VR headsets: take regular breaks and stop playing if you feel excessively sick or dizzy.)  Budget Right\\nMy Team this year launches with some awesome new features including adaptive budgets. These make the game more accessible or challenging, depending on how you choose to set it up! Of course, these will influence how much money you begin your journey with.  Newcomer: not much money, but lots of hope and goodwill – and few expectations of success so no pressure on your driving skills! Challenger: think you’re good and want to have a chance to prove yourself. Come on then! Frontrunner: nothing but the best, all the way. But you’re the red-hot favourite and expected to not only win but to break records and look effortlessly cool while doing it!\\nF1 22 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/images/products/10550/616x353/f1-22-pc-game-ea-app-cover.jpg?v=1705327981\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 233}),\n",

About the Game\\nThere is a mixture of events in the game, where the player must either race cleanly, aiming to be first, or where you can play dirty, sabotaging your opponent’s car by shunting them off the track or driving them into a wall. \\nYou begin the game by choosing your vehicle, from a lengthy and comprehensive list that includes CAT earthmovers, Caddies and Chevrolets, a showroom’s worth of Fords, Pontiacs, Rovers and VW Beetles amongst many others. There is even a Volvo bus if size and strength are your thing. You can customise your paintwork, but do not get too attached to it, as each race or outing will surely leave it in need of a refresh! \\nNext you choose between manual and automatic. Manual is great if you are a fan of simulation racing games, automatic if you are out to score speed and destruction prizes without wanting the stress of gear changes and potential stalls holding you back. \\nFinally, you choose between dirt and tarmac tracks, of which there are many. Various speedways, raceways, rings and motocenters are waiting for your attentions, or you can hit the countryside in certain areas, bringing an element of hair-raising rallying to your game.  Bonus Challenges\\nEvery race has bonus features, so that even if you are not winning – or are not even interested in winning, being bent on causing as much destruction as possible – you can still accumulate points, XP and other rewards. \\nSome of these challenges are quite broadly defined: ‘Cause a set number of opponents to crash out’, while others are more precise: ‘Cause a set number of opponents to spin out’. Spinning out is defined as forcing your opponent’s car to spin a full 180 degrees because of your actions alone.  \\nOther challenges differ in difficulty according to which race you attempt to achieve them in. ‘Finishing off an opponent’ is quite tricky in a speed race but much more achievable in a demolition derby – just look for a player with low HP and deal the killing blow yourself to gain the win!  Three Ways to Play Career: a fairly premise begins your career. Win races from a set selection, and as you rise in the ranks, more events will present themselves. Unlike in the other modes, keeping your vehicle in reasonable condition and coming first in the race is more important than accumulating damage and taking out opponents (although there are ‘side quests’ to tick off, such as causing three opponents to crash out). Your results in the standings are key Multiplayer: indulge your inner psychopath by t-boning your opponents and relishing the physics engines that make each smash a sumptuous feast of crumpling metal, authentic metallic screams and debris flying far and wide, with – fairly often – a single tyre bouncing out of the crush and rolling away sadly as though fleeing a crime scene Custom Events: from the slapstick hilarity of a ride-on lawnmower race (but make no mistake, people will do almost anything to win, even this!) to a full-on Destruction Derby (which is what the name implies) to a Dirt Showdown which is basically a full on battle royale but for cars, in which players battle each other to be the last vehicle standing. Or driving . Moving anyway! \\nWreckfest for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive.FEATURES  Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style.    Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too.    Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear.    Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No \"hero\" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life.    You are not the chosen one. You\\'re not great and powerful. You don\\'t have more \\'hitpoints\\' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.   Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business.    Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself.    Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won\\'t stop moving. This is not just a \"game\", you are living and surviving in a simulated world.   Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength.    Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don\\'t change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won\\'t hold your hand or help you when you\\'re down.    Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation.    Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base.    Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment.    Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives.    Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/3416/pcover/3416.jpg?v=1649409828', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 249}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 254\\nname: Dead by Daylight\\ndescription: Dead by Daylight for PC is a survival horror game from Behaviour Interactive.   About the Game \\nThere are broadly speaking two ways to play: four online players join forces against a single killer, also an online player. So you can be the killer or you can be one of the four working against him or her.  Villainous Villains\\nThere are a number of original villains to square up against or to play as, and there are a number of downloadable characters from popular culture, such as Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Freddy Krueger from Nightmare on Elm Street, John Kramer from Saw, Evil Ash from Evil Dead and the Scream-faced killer from the Scream movie franchise. \\nThere are sixteen original killers, mostly with one word names prefaced by the word ‘the’: The Nurse, The Clown, The Trapper, with only The Ghost Face having an adjective. \\nVillains are one-paced, with a moderately fast walk-run their only gait. However, this is ever so slightly faster than their victims can run, so in a straight race, the villains will always win. Villains must strike their prey twice, once to injure and slow them down, a second time to incapacitate them completely. Injured players can be caught more easily while trying to evade the killer, while those with full strength can resist better and dodge faster.   Survivor Tactics\\nThere are a total of seventeen survivors that the four cooperative players can choose to be. Diversity is reasonably good with most people able to pick avatars that correspond with their preferred look. As villains can outrun survivors in a straight run, the survivors need to get a little bit ingenious in order to escape. They have to fix a set number of generators (usually five, one for each player including the killer), in order to fix the gates that will set them free. \\nAn alternative mode of escape is to reach an escape hatch which automatically opens for them when there is only one survivor remaining. More than one survivor means that the hatch will require a key to be located and used if that means of escape is to be used.\\nPlayers’ movements are fairly varied, with two paces: walk and sprint, although, as mentioned above, sprint is still slightly slower than the villain’s one-paced gait. Players can also crouch-walk and crawl, both of which come in handy when players are trying to avoid the killer by remaining out of his or her sight-line.  \\nPlayers cannot outrun the villains, so they must dodge out of sight either before they are spotted or within the duration of a chase scene, while the villain is still far away enough to be evaded.  Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\nAs well as watching out for the villain (when playing as the villain you only have one task: find the survivors and change that status!) survivors should keep an eye out for the following useful items:  Flashlights – shine a flashlight into the eyes of the killer and it will momentarily dazzle them, allowing survivors to rescue a captured buddy before the villain can sacrifice him or her Med-kits – first aid kits so survivors can heal themselves without needing to wait for a buddy to come along and heal them Tool boxes – can be used to sabotage the meat-hooks on which the villain displays his bodies, and they can also spring bear traps harmlessly, making the area safe for survivors Maps – these useful tools track objects, making it easier to find them Pallets – these massive wooden boxes can be stood on end and dropped by a passing survivor onto the villain, momentarily stunning him or her, so the survivor can get ahead and try and find somewhere to lie low\\nDead by Daylight for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 256\\nname: Dragon Ball FighterZ\\ndescription: Dragon Ball FighterZ for PC is a 2.5D fighting game based on the original Japanese manga series of the same name. Despite the capital Z at the end of the name, the word is pronounced as the regular word ‘fighters’ with no especial emphasis on the final sibilant.   About the Game\\nThe player chooses two fellow fighters and faces up to a team of three opposing rivals. The battle is won when all three opponents are defeated – or lost when your whole team goes down. You will only control one character at a time, but you can call upon your teammates to perform specialised combo moves and to work together when necessary. \\nEach character has moves that are unique to them while there are several moves that are universal – that is to say, all the fighters can perform them. Read more about these moves below. Once you have mastered the universal moves, make sure that you try out as many of the unique moves as possible: there are twenty-four characters to choose between so you will have a good choice of new skills that you like or are particularly good at.  Rendering SkillZ & Fighting Mojo\\nThe game looks great and the play rate is smooth because each character is carefully modelled in 3D but textured to match the 2D manga cartoon style that looks hand-drawn while offering authentic and dynamic movement capability. \\nThe fighting part is easily mastered after a little practice, being fairly intuitive and relatively simple. You can tailor your attacks from light to toy with your opponent or get them to move into a better position to unleash a combo-storm on them, to medium to show you’re not messing around, to full power to administer the coup de grace and dispatch them from the game altogether.  A Lot of Back Story\\nThe video game series is rooted in the manga book series, as mentioned above, and this gives the writers a lot of fertile ground to work through. The book series has been running for well over thirty years, and features hundreds of characters and androids, along with many different storylines to play through. \\nThe game developers have wisely kept things fairly simple, using only a few (twenty-four) of the hundreds of characters and keeping the storylines simple with enough challenging battles and enough believability to keep a player engaged from the first step until the last. \\nThe characters’ stories all have linking shots that revel a little more about them, and offer tantalising teasers to their back stories – all of which can encourage newbies to the game and series to investigate a bit more, finding out the meaning of the hints and unravelling mysterious clues about their character.  Universal Moves and Some Others Vanish Attack: sacrifice some Ki to vanish from your opponent’s sight and reappear behind them from where you can safely stab them in the back. Unsporting, but effective!  Dragon Rush: overwhelm your opponent’s guard and force them to change team members or take refuge with an aerial combo. A highly effective manoeuvre when performed correctly Super Dash: this powerful flying attack homes in on the lead opponent and passes through lesser barriers as though they aren’t there Ki Charge: allows players to manually charge their Ki gauge – a highly useful feat that has been seen in other games in the series\\nDragon Ball FighterZ for PC for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Play through World War Two as often as you like, tweaking weightings and scenarios to see the different potential outcomes, or reworking history to see it play out in front of your eyes. The game offers two start dates: 1936 or 1939, and you can proceed well beyond the end of the war, but anything after 1950 is more or less unplayable. \\nYou can play this game alone, or as part of a multiplayer game, choosing almost any historical character you like. However, do note that this is not an open world game, nor is it sandbox-style. There are scenarios that must be worked through – but they are massive scenarios with multiple outcomes to play through, so it can feel quite open and unrestricted unless you are wanting to create an alternative history that the developers haven’t thought of.  What’s the Story?\\nIn this intensely detailed but broad-ranging game you must arrange the world to suit your own preferred story. While much of the play occurs at the national level, it is possible to zoom in on the minutiae too, if that is your preference. So you can micromanage the doings in a small Russian town, population a few hundred, or you can zoom out massively, and send a sweeping attack across the whole of West Africa.  \\nYou can choose to operate from any one of the impressive 11,000 regions that are detailed on the game map – and detailed is exactly the right word! You can check the weather, what time sunrise and sunsets occur, the terrain and what supply lines are in place, before committing your time and attention to the area.  \\nAnd it does not have to be an area that was involved directly with WWII – you can play an alternative history in which it was, thanks to the detailed world mapping and immense control offered by the game. The work that has gone into all these alt-histories is incredible, and there for your enjoyment!  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game relies only to a certain extent on AI, and often, if planning complex combat missions, you will have to actively guide your troops, if, for example, you have two rally points. The troops will not divide themselves and one rally point will become overused, while the other is almost ignored. Either of these are problematic: your crowded point will not be able to feed and house so many soldiers, while the other is easy prey for alert enemy combatants! \\nIf you love this sort of intense armchair strategizing, this game is perfect for you. You can rework WWII over and over, seeing how even quite small changes make the outcomes change. You do have to pay attention though: neglecting your allies can have them leave you hanging, just as you are marching on the enemy, confidently expecting their backup when suddenly, whoops, you are all along and the Nazis are coming!  \\nIt can be hard in the heat of global battle to keep track of all the small stuff: heroic companies going above and beyond, excellent performance by revamped weapons proving the wisdom of early investment, etc, but it is a necessary skill to play the game fully, especially when you are managing multiple armies.  Who’s on My Side?\\nAny nation can have armed forces, which are supported by the civilians in the country. Civilian factories build equipment and many military items that allow for military factories to be built: the armed forces would be in a poor position if they were to alienate the civilian population of the country!  \\nThere are three types of armed forces to be trained, deployed and used to further the interests of the nation:   Navy – Naval forces are obviously sea-based, ideal for carrying long, heavy loads.

              " Document(page_content=': 274\\nname: Battlefield 2042\\ndescription: Battlefield 2042 for PC is a first person shooter video game with a strong multiplayer focus. The game, the twelfth in the series (and which also boasts over forty expansion packs throughout the franchise), is set in the fairly near future (as evidenced by the name) which means there are plenty of high-tech and futuristic weapons and gadgets – such as deployable drones, turrets, and robot dogs.     About the Game\\nAs touched on above, the world’s climate has slipped into extremes, causing a large number of people to flee their now untenable homes. These climate refugees are calls No-Pats meaning they are stateless and have ‘no country’. The climate crisis has dramatically worsened, causing the collapse of the EU and heightening tensions between the USA and Russia to the point of war.    \\nEvents on Earth come to a head when a Kessler Syndrome* event occurs in 2040, knocking out seventy percent of international communications satellites. Already tense, the USA and Russia are poised on the brink of war. \\nA Kessler Syndrome event will occur, according to science, when a chain reaction of collisions within the thick space junk belt whizzing around the planet (debris from space missions, lost or jettisoned for whatever reason) affect those things in orbit that we rely on for day to day work and play: the carefully positioned satellites that operate phone systems, internet connections as well as television and radio comms.    \\nWar finally breaks out in 2042, just in time for you to come along to save the day. Or play your part in the day-saving, anyway.   What’s New and What Stayed the Same?\\nThe Plus system is new, and improved: players can now upgrade their weapons on the fly, and while the class system is broadly the same but with a massive and much-needed overhaul. Classes are now called ‘specialisms’ and you can explore any skill tree, instead of being limited to your class as before. The names remain the same, Assault, Engineer, Medic, Recon etc, so if you have a favourite, you can quickly find what you’re looking for.    \\nExtreme weather effects have made the jump from the previous game in the series, and given that there’s a climate emergency, you will not be surprised to learn that tornadoes can suck you up and give you a hard time before spitting you out again – hopefully! – while sand storms reduce your visibility quite massively. And that can be a problem in the middle of a battlefield…     \\nInstead of single player mode, but there are three main gameplay modes: All-out Warfare – which comprises of: Breakthrough (in which you try to take out the other team’s control points) and Conquest (in which two teams battle for a single control point). Hazard Zone is the multiplayer co-op zone and the place to be! There is support for up to 128 players in two teams of 64.  \\nFinally, in the ‘what’s new’ column, there are autonomous vehicles that players can commandeer as and when they need them. If there are no handy cars around, players can even request a vehicle to be airdropped to them – why not think out of the box and get a tank dropped onto an enemy sniper, and make life a tiny bit easier for yourself?     Where is the Game Set?\\nThe game pretty comprehensively covers the globe, with 7 maps available from the off:   Orbital – to the top of South America, set in Guiana’s Space Centre near Kourou Hourglass – found in the near east: Doha, Qatar on the coast of Persian Gulf Kaleidoscope – North of Japan is where you find Songdo International Business District in South Korea Manifest – sort of midway between India and Australia can be found the island of Pulau Brani off the south coast of Singapore Discarded – Alang, high on the west coast of India, whose beaches are home to an immense real-life ships’ graveyard of derelict vessels Breakaway – So far north that every other direct is south places you on Queen Maud Land in the Arctic Circle, a territory of Norway Revival – Possibly visited by pharaohs back in the day, the Eastern Desert, the easternmost part of the Sahara, where it borders on the Nile is a good place to explore \\nBattlefield 2042 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 275\\nname: The Elder Scrolls Online\\ndescription: The Elder Scrolls Online for PC is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that is part of the Elder Scrolls series and the first multiplayer offering from the game. Set on the fictional continent of Tamriel – as are all the other games in the series – the game is not directly linked to any of the others, being instead a standalone offering in a world that would be familiar to regular players but still accessible to newcomers. \\nMore than ten million people have played the games since its initial release, and around a million people per month are registered as playing their way through the game at any point.  About the Game\\nPlay is non-linear with players able to choose quests from a smorgasbord of options. You can roam freely around the world, playing sandbox style and stumbling across the secrets of Tamriel and choosing to help with quests or not, as you like. Alternatively, you can accept every quest that is offered, and watch out for random events, taking advantage of the chance to gather prizes by winning your way to the top of the leader board. \\nThere are two simultaneous conflicts going on: a battle for the Imperial Throne which will offer the winner power over all Tamriel, and a fight against Prince Molag Bal, a Daedra, who must be stopped from completing his mission. The player can take his or her time over completing these tasks, exploring far and wide and ignoring these twin calls to action until they are ready to get to work on them.  How to Play\\nYou begin play along with many others, trying to retrieve your soul from Molag Bal, and manage to escape from his clutches. From there, you can play your way around the world, gathering equipment and completing missions until you attain level 10. At this point, competitive play is possible, and you are given more information and deeper missions with every gain of five levels. \\nAs with many MMORPGs you will spend a lot of your time battling other players as they try to beat you to the treasure or simply off you because you’re in their way. Keep your inventory well stocked and make sure your weapons are easily to hand and that you know how to use them, or else you risk facing an untimely demise along with all the attendant annoyances that come with sudden death.  Pick Your Species and Race\\nThere are ten different races, each of which fall under one of three species. They are as follows:  Human Races: Nords, Redguards, Bretons, Imperials – these human races work well together and have distinct differences in how they look, ranging from skin colour to mode of dress Elvish Races: Dunmer (Dark Elves), Altmer (High Elves), Bosmer (wood Elves), Orsimer (Orc Elves) – elves are also known as the ‘mer’ and they are much longer-lived than humans, with lifespans of up to two or three hundred years. Perhaps because of this, they are conditionally fertile, only becoming so when populations drop too low and a birth-rate boost is required to restore population levels Bestial Races: Khajiit, Argonians – as the name sounds, beastfolk are chimera, sentient half-men half-beast beings. They vary greatly, even amongst themselves, much like comparing mammals amongst themselves. They have unusual metabolisms, skeletal structures and powers, and any player who chooses to be one of these characters must take a moment to learn the advantages and disadvantages of the beastfolk form they have chosen \\nAlong with these choices, players must also pick classes and skill sets for their characters. Each choice affects the abilities and talents of their avatar, strengthening them in certain areas and weakening them in others: so do be careful to choose wisely! \\nThe Elder Scrolls Online for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. \\nEvery location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.GAMEPLAY FEATURES   COHESIVE \"LIVED-IN\" WORLD Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.   FULL BODY AWARENESS\\nPlayers will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc.   INVENTORY AND AMMO MANAGEMENT\\nYour loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game.

              " Document(page_content=': 278\\nname: Green Hell\\ndescription: Green Hell for PC is a survival game in an open world format, where the player must survive – and try to thrive – in an unusual location for such games which are usually set in deserts or arid landscapes – places survival is hard because of a lack of resources. This game parks you firmly on the banks of the Amazon river with all the dangers that entails: poisonous plants, bad water, dangerous creatures and natives who may or may not welcome intruders into their domain!   About the Game\\nIn story mode you are Dr Jake Higgins – again an apparent improvement on other survival games, as it means you start with some advantages and knowledge. You are looking to find your wife, Mia, who is bent on making friends with local tribespeople because she speaks their language – she is Jake’s interpreter, as well as his partner.  \\nHowever, this rather blinds her to the dangers of those who do not wish her well, and Jake, whose only current contact with her is via a radio, must keep himself alive and track her down before it is too late. Jake’s progress is constrained by the need to learn on the go, making and then using tools that give him access to more of the jungle, each one hopefully taking him ever closer to Mia. There are multiple endings, so the game is worth replaying to see how the other endings play out.  Need to Know \\nJake is armed with a useful satellite watch which doubles as your health monitor and a compass to keep you on track. Your inventory all fits into your backpack, so it is with you all the time, and you save by building a shelter, wherever you are. Remember to save before committing yourself to a tricky crossing or feat, and in a place where you are relatively safe – it’s mildly irritating to repeatedly die seconds into any save! \\nIt’s not just basic food along with clean water and sleep that you need in this game, you need to get the right balance of fats, carbs and proteins which makes it a lot trickier to accomplish, despite the abundance of potential nourishment all around you. You can check your limbs, one at a time and in fair detail, so you can spot wounds, leeches, bugs, bites and rashes as soon as they start affecting your health status. \\nThere is also a sanity bar which you should keep an eye on, especially when Jake is particularly stressed, ill or exhausted! If you start losing your mind, your grip on reality wanders and the music becomes poignant, and the colour drains from the world. The jungle will try and kill you even harder in this state, but you can recover by performing ‘normal’ actions, such as curing minor illnesses, drinking good water, eating well, and getting caught up on your sleep etc.   Ways to Play\\nThe beginning of story mode – about ten minutes or so – is identical to the tutorial, and it cannot be skipped, so you could miss the tutorial and dive straight into story mode. If you survive first time out (highly unlikely!) you will be away, without needing to do it all again, for real this time.  \\nYou can play with a buddy in story mode, and have a friend along to keep an eye out for danger, slap a cure together and generally look out for each other. \\nCo-operative multi-play is also available in online survival mode where you and three others work to keep the team alive and on the move. \\nWhichever mode you play, it is possible to survive, but the game does not make it easy – you have to work at it and you may well finish the game exhausted and feeling as though the real Amazon wouldn’t be quite so determined to make you dead! In both modes there are plenty of missions and side quests to work through. \\nCrafting is – surprisingly – super simple. Just gather what you need – usually just one of each item – and then drag and drop them together and voila, the item is made. You must have a shelter to save the game, as mentioned above, so make the first one early and then save often as you progress!  \\nPro tip – coconuts are your friend! They are clean water, food and even bowls all in one. Gather as many as you can carry!  Exciting Ways to Die in the Jungle!\\nJaguars will kill you with enthusiasm, enjoying you for dinner while you curse and respawn, trying to remember exactly where they were so as to avoid them this time round, but there are a great many ways to die in this appropriately named green hell – here are just some of them!  Arrows – not all the locals are happy to see you, and despite Mia’s insistences, some of them will happily try to kill you! Falls – all that lush green growth can be deceptive, with lethal drops suddenly opening under your unwary feet Venom – famously, venom is what snakes squirt into when they bite, poison is what kills you should you eat it. But you are not going to be bothered about using the right word when snakes are falling out of trees and biting you, creeping up behind you and biting you, or appearing apparently out of nowhere and – you guessed it – biting you! Poison – watch what you eat, as some of the berries, animals and leaves will, if not outright kill you (although some do!), make you very ill, and open to dying from any number of other causes. Dehydration – just as in real life, not drinking enough water is a major problem. And despite the fact that there is plenty of water, unlike in other survival games, you need to be careful about drinking it! Water must be clean and bug free if it isn’t going to make you sick. Oh, and check yourself, if you’ve been near water you almost certainly have a leech or twenty somewhere about your person! This will make Jake’s health bar start dropping, so be sure to sort it quickly!\\nGreen Hell for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

This incarnation is the tenth main release in the franchise and amazingly, the 26th including all the spin-offs and remakes, making Resident Evil one of the most prolific games out there! Resident Evil Village is sometimes called Resident Evil 8: Village, and the developers have spotted that they can create a hidden puzzle within the title, which is rendered with roman numerals for eight VIII instead of the Vill of Villagers. As in V I I.I. AGE. Clever!   About the Game\\nThe game is first-person game, that allows for six-player online multi-play when preferred. The game is set a few years after the previous game, Resident Evil Seven, and Ethan Winters is once again the protagonist along with his wife, Mia, also from RE7 (see the list of important characters, below, for more).  \\nEthan’s inventory items are kept in a virtual ‘briefcase’ which he keeps with himself at all times, paying periodic visits to a vendor called Duke who sells weapons and healing items. This version of the game places a greater focus on exploration and combat than the other versions of the game, but the underlying story is both fascinating and compelling (and scary too, in places!). \\nVIII is a bit more open world than its predecessor, so you can explore and stretch your character more than was permitted in the strictly linear progress of the previous game. \\nEthan is surprised when Chris suddenly visits and disrupts his peaceful life. Events play out in such a way that Ethan has no choice but to chase after Chris in search of answers. Ethan tracks Chris to a remote village – that of the title of the game, obviously – and realises that things are not all they seem… \\nThe nearby castle is home to a nearly three metre tall vampire woman, with a nest of hungry daughters, while spooky… things, let us call them, flicker at the edge of Ethan’s vision, darting out of sight when he tries to catch a proper look at them. Throw enormous blue werewolves into the mix, and you would think that Ethan’s hands are full enough – but there are more shocks to come!   RE: Verse Bonus\\nFree to all Resident Evil Village owners, is access to Resident Evil RE: Verse, the online game. This game incorporates all the fan favourite characters and locations from the whole franchise, and don’t worry if you get killed. In a fun twist, if you die in RE: Verse, you instantly respawn as a bioweapon, so you can get beautiful karmic revenge on whoever killed you!  \\nAside from coming with VIII there is no real connection between the two, certainly not as far as storyline goes.   Dramatis Personae Ethan Winter – the protagonist of the game, he has survived RE7 and settled down to a comfortable married life until events force him up and about Mia Winters – one of the main protagonists of RE7, alongside her now-husband Ethan, with whom she is expecting a baby Chris Redfield – a shock blast from the past, Chris pops up and violently disrupts Ethan’s contented life. What does he really want, though? Alcina Dimitrescu – a cheerful and beautiful vampire, Alcina puts Hagrid to shame, standing a hefty 9-foot 6 tall. That’s scrape-the-ceiling tall and duck-through-every-doorway tall Alcina’s Daughters – not quite as tall as their Mama, these ladies are somewhat lacking in the beauty department too!

              " Document(page_content=': 282\\nname: Starfield\\ndescription: Starfield for PC is an action role-playing game from the makers of the ridiculously successful Skyrim and Fallout 4, and it can be played from either first- or third- person perspectives. According to the game developers, they are hoping that this is the start of a huge franchise, similar to the two series mentioned above. As this is the first new game in 25 years (since the above games first came out), expectations and hopes are sky high.     About the Game\\nThe game is set 300 years in the future, when regular space exploration is not only happening, but it has also become very normalised. You are a member of Constellation, which is an organisation of space explorers – the last organisation of space explorers, in fact. Don’t waste time wondering what happened to all the other explorers and why they’re reduced to one group, get on with the game! \\nConstellation ships have a vibe in which steam punk meets NASA perfectly. The developers have termed it ‘NASA-punk’ and it teams sleek futuristic perfection with nuts and bolts basics that looks inviting and homey without losing confidence that the ships will actually fly and keep you alive while you get where you are going!   \\nAnd where are you going? Just about anywhere you like. The game is essentially an open world in space in which you can just get in your ship and off you go. Exploration is not limited to space and the planets, you can pick up and examine a lot of things, such as books, boxes, and there are tons of exciting buttons to press to see what happens!  \\nYour astronaut character is fully customisable (and there are a surprising number of changes that you can make to a space suit, you will be happy to learn) and you also get your own little assistant in the form of robot, Vasquez (Vasco for short). You can tweak your stats, your backstory and everything about your physical appearance, until you have the perfect character in which to game away.  \\nThe game is packed with thoughtful plotting and nuanced shades of morality, in which life lessons are so subtly delivered you barely notice them, even as you reap the consequences of your actions, good or bad!     The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game features a procedurally generated world to keep the game size down, and it is the first games which uses game studio Bethesda’s revamped Creation Engine, called Creation Engine 2. In this first serious outing for the platform, it is so well done that your mouth will water, for example, just looking at that delicious looking cheddar cheese and salami sandwich (with red pickled onions, lettuce and Dijon mustard, in case you want to try it out).  \\nWeapons are solid and satisfying in the hand, (with an homage to the Master Chief if you know where to look) and the space ship boasts various gauges and systems to keep tabs on for the good of your health and the ship’s. These include oxygen and carbon dioxide monitors, your individual mission suggestions, and even the shopping list – you don’t want to run out of soothing Tranquillitea now, do you? (That’s pronounced ‘tranquillity, by the way.) \\nYou will play over varying terrains, from metropolises, alien jungles, alien deserts – these complete with crablike aliens, of course, and a city on stilts over a sea-sized body of water. Each offers unique challenges for you in completing your missions, but also offers advantages too, if you know where to find them. You can wear different suits for the changing terrains.    \\nYou will battle the Pirates of the Crimson Fleet, which is a loose alliance of villains and outlaws as they invade the United Colonies’ territories (planets belonging to good guys) of Sagan, Cheyenne, Lunara, and Narion. You will team up with SysDef and the Freestar Collective to beat them back – or you can join the crimson side if that appeals more. Or, maybe do some mercenary work for them, getting mucky rather than full on down and dirty? \\nKeep your eyes open for the distinctive and very recognisable first aid packs for when your health or stamina needs topping up. The game was inspired by NASA – but a futuristic NASA in an alternate future – and Elon Musk and Space X collectively.  \\nThere are aliens in the game, on alien planets with alien cities, but based as much in reality as possible with necessary flights of imagination to allow for sentient, human-sized beings for the convenience of game play!     What Are We Seeking?\\nWith exploration into space there are a number of reasons to go all that way. In real life, it is usually money or power (or both!) but in this game, it is left a little more mystically open:   Religion: does God exist? Or are there just super-powerful aliens who decided to interfere with our little spinning ball of rock? You can choose the spiritual side when seeing if you can find out the real secrets of life, the universe and all that Science: what elements can be found in space? How do things behave under different atmospheric conditions? Can anyone hear you scream? Conduct experiences, collect samples and data and make the world a better place for all Sci-fi: explore beyond the known by getting to grips with alien culture, languages and weaponry. Make friends in strange places, and influence politics towards diversity on a truly cosmic scale – or not, if their intentions are not ideal! \\nStarfield for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 285\\nname: Construction Simulator Extended Edition\\ndescription: Construction Simulator Extended Edition for PC is an open world simulation game that allows you to experience the joys of handling heavy machinery such as trucks and excavators to create new buildings, clear ground and more.   About the Game\\nCompete for contracts, hire and buy new plant and equipment from genuine brand names (see below for more details). You can choose from over ninety vehicles from over 70 different manufacturers for an authentic and immersive driving and digging experience. \\nUnlike many simulation games, this one comes with a backstory: you take over the construction business from a guy, Hape, whose dream is to see the city restored to its former glory. Hape pops up from time to time, in game, as your mentor.\\nWhile some of his ideas are a little strange, to say the least: hiding a UFO to encourage tourists to come along, amongst them – nevertheless your early projects attract interest from other contractors around the town, and you end up with more sensible contracts such as renovating the harbour and helping the inner city regain some dignity. \\nAs well as these major contracts (you have up to 90 to fulfil over the course of the game), you can also do side jobs for locals, which include everything from installing pipes to laying down parking lots. \\nOff work you can drive around in a sleek sports car, which is handy for getting around the two large maps (one in Germany, Europe, one in small-town USA). When you’re waiting for deliveries or just feel like a break, you can walk around the open world town to explore a bit. While you work and play, there are one hundred golden hammers scattered throughout the game for you to find as a bit of added fun.   The Nitty Gritty\\nThe wider maps – you unlock map areas as you discover them – aren’t minutely detailed, as with some other games, but that really doesn’t matter as the developers have poured in the visual expertise where it is needed: on the machines which are so minutely detailed that a heavy machinery mechanic would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the game and their real life job! Even the engine noises from idling to revving are spot on. \\nYour character, unusually for simulator games, is customisable with up to nine helmet choices, a selection of eye protection and ear defenders. You even have ecological choices and going green is a good way to play. You are guaranteed to find quests that will let you try out and test every piece of equipment you earn \\nAs with many similar games you start off small and easy, earning your way up to more difficult, complex jobs with accordingly higher earnings. \\nBut this game gets the balance exactly right – unlike some other games that quickly become all but impossible to succeed at, or which keep you trapped on a hard level for hours and hours while you wait for funds to accumulate or skill levels to rise high enough to complete you contract. This game offers the right balance of challenge vs frustrations – which is a pleasant surprise. \\nYou can fast travel to place you’ve been before, but this is for a fee. It is worth paying, however, when you’re moving lots of equipment to site, to save time and potential fines. Do bear in mind, too, that breaking traffic rules will earn you a fine, so mind the rules of the road when out and about! \\nComplete contracts to buy machines, earns money and build your business. Play alone or recruit up to three friends to help you out on your crew. Game play is made easy with excellent tutorials, comprehensive menus and a great user interface – as well as a reset button for when your machinery has somehow got backed up into a corner!   What Do You Drive?\\nYou can hire and buy new plant and equipment from genuine brand names (over 70 of them!). To name just a few: Caterpillar: the world leaders in construction and mining equipment Leibherr: another world leader in construction equipment, with added expertise in adding tech to their machinery John Deere: from a relatively humble start as an agricultural equipment supplier, there guys now produce all sorts of heavy equipment BELL: manufacturers of mining, construction, forestry and agricultural equipment that is used all over the world, from South Africa to Europe to Oceania DAF: long known for being manufacturers of HGVs and lorries, DAF have expanded their offer into the world of construction Kenworth: in business for one hundred years, Kenworth are adaptable, creating war vehicles in the second world war and segueing seamlessly into construction in time for the building boom in 1950s USA Doosan: a Korean powerhouse, Doosan makes technology embracing heavy and light vehicles to fill every construction and warehousing need Bobcat: Actually a subsidiary of Doosan, Bobcat has been in business for over 75 years and still has a unique and recognisable logo separate from its relatively new adoptive parent. It specialises in compact construction equipment designed to fit into small spaces to complete tasks CASE: a worldwide supplier of construction and earth moving equipment, big and small\\nConstruction Simulator Extended Edition for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Player discretion is advised.  IMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and builds tension slowly to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. Its story is unveiled through surreal imaging and subtle environment details. Be mindful that it is a difficult game in unconventional ways. \\nVisage is a first-person psychological horror game. \\nExplore a mysterious ever-changing house in a slow-paced, atmospheric world that combines both uncannily comforting and horrifyingly realistic environments, and enjoy a genuinely terrifying experience.EnvironmentThe game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes you to places you couldn't even bear imagining.  StorylineThis house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?  Dark entitiesThe families that died in the house will haunt you and leave you restless. They’ll follow your every move, watch you from every corner, play tricks with your mind, and try to attack you. Why do they haunt you? What have you done? This you have to find out on your own.  GameplayIn Visage, you are defenseless; no weapons could save you from the dreadful entities stalking you from the next corner, the next door, or underneath your feet. You’ll be able to pick up key elements, interact with the environment, and search for things that may help you escape this nightmare or pull you deeper into it.   \\nDying is part of the game. You need to avoid terror at all costs, as dark entities are attracted to it. Maintaining your mind as sane as possible will keep you from joining the ranks of the dead. Doing so will not be easy, and you'll have to figure out ways, like staying in the light, to avoid going insane.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/6394/pcover/6394.jpg?v=1709114484\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 292}),\n",

But before you even get to the game, you will enjoy customising your character and exploring the skill trees, which are nicely flexible to allow your unique preferences to shape your character.  \\nUp to four players (cross-play is allowed) can team up to pull off the heists – they can be your friends or random strangers, depending on your set-up – and you will all have to pull your own weight to succeed. Unlike the strictly linear progress of the first game, you can explore your options before committing to one path of action or another, which is nicely freeing.   \\nNot only can you take hostages, but you can trade them to get more time or resurrect a comrade. You might need to resort to these measures as the games get more complex the longer you play, despite the vast improvements to movements and manoeuvrability which make entirely stealth games possible. \\nWeapons are satisfyingly punchy to use, and you can use hostages as a shield which forces your enemies to try and get close to you to rescue them before tackling you – a good way to survive while you cross in front of the entire police force! You have thirty weapons to choose from, with plenty of choice to kit your character out to your satisfaction.     What Missions Are There?\\nThe game kicks off with eight jobs available right away. Most games can be played two ways: full combat and stealthily. This game’s stealth options are more advanced than the first two games, and it is more possible to complete missions entirely using stealth. The missions include, amongst others:   Under the Surphase: an art museum heist that requires puzzle solving to get away with the priceless artworks Gold and Shark Bank: A good old-fashioned bank heist that sees you getting to grips with a loaded, but securely locked, vault Road Rage: An all-action armoured van heist which is a little more linear than the other missions, and has little scope for stealth so load up your best weapons before you head off to grab the loot! \\nPayday 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/6442/pcover/6442.jpg?v=1696580204', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 298}),\n",

Roguelike refers to games that tend to be based underground, with dark themes and the threat of permadeath of the player’s character, although some roguelike games have other tendencies within them. \\nMetroidvania is a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania and refers to games which offer a series of rooms or areas which can only be played through after the player has gathered certain items, such as keys, or a series of items that will help to find the key. Occasionally it is certain skills or tools that must be acquired before the player can move on. These games are usually, but not always, side-scrolling.  About the Game\\nThe player, in the above-mentioned, rather grisly guise, must explore the room or chamber in which they find themselves, gathering weapons, treasure and tools as they go. Their way is hindered by a number of undead creatures, who can be found at various points throughout the game. \\nThe in-game currency, known as cells, can also be found, like treasure, and then used to purchase permanent upgrades and to unlock previously unreached levels. However, the player must reach the store in between successfully completing levels: dying during a level causes the loss of all the equipment and cells that the player has gathered but not yet stored.  What’s the Story?\\nThe player is The Prisoner and the game begins with a soldier letting you know that you have been trying to effect an escape from the dungeon in which you are currently being kept for quite a long time. Not to be daunted, you promptly resume your attempt to get out. \\nAs you explore your way through the dungeons, the backstory of the island is revealed: a mysterious plague, called ‘The Malaise’ swept through the island nation, transforming the once-mighty kingdom’s population to mindless husks or zombies. The player must fight his way through to the throne room and kill the king – whereupon the game resets and the player must start all over again. \\nOnce he reaches the throne room again, a startling fact is made clear to The Prisoner, who must put things together in order to set the world to rights. However, everything is not what it seems and the Prisoner will feel as though he is battling himself at times, before all is resolved – or is it?  Playing for Keepers\\nThe various sections of the game are guarded by Keepers who are, loosely, level bosses. There are six of them altogether: The Concierge: the first gatekeeper that the Prisoner comes up against, this monstrous hulk used to be the king’s guard before his subsequent infection with The Malaise, which transformed him hideously Conjunctivious: the very name of this creature sounds painful! Once a bloated corpse, this Keeper has been transformed into tentacled monster of Lovecraftian appearance The Time Keeper: this female Keeper has power over time, and continuously resets every day to prevent her own infection. Her skills might be the key to overall success, you may find, so keep an eye on the time… The Giant: this massive skeleton creature was added via DLC after the game’s initial release and is the Keeper for The Cavern. He reveals a previously unknown fact to the Prisoner: a fact that changes everything The Hand of the King: the king’s personal guard, this Keeper must be defeated before the Prisoner can face off with the king, who is seemingly comatose but still on his throne The Collector: this Keeper will trade you valuables in exchange for cells. Cells can be obtained by being found, as mentioned above, but also from killing enemies whose dead bodies will drop whatever cells they are carrying Blacksmith: Not a keeper, but worth an honourable mention: the blacksmith will upgrade and improve your weapons and ammunition\\nDead Cells for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 311\\nname: Among Us\\ndescription: Among Us for PC is a perfect variations of a murder mystery theme, with the game’s template apparently lifted from an (admittedly, rather futuristic!) Agathat Christie novel. There are a set number of people in an enclosed space, with no ways in or out. Of the people within the space, one, two or three are not who they seem! It is an online multiplayer social deception game, and it is the unexpected juxtaposition of the other players that makes the game so compulsive and unique.  What’s the Intriguing Story?\\nYou are either a crewmate or an imposter – you will be slipped a note, giving you your real personalised instructions, if you are an imposter – working through a set series of tasks.  \\nAs an imposter, which is arguably more fun, you must follow your own list of instructions, which include sabotaging the crewmates’ work and killing them. Imposters have special ways of moving secretly through vents, which enables them to get up to their nefarious naughtinesses. \\nCrewmates work to achieve mini-game goals, usually to do with maintaining or fixing up the play area (more about which below!) and it is possible to win the game simply by completing all the task, although more commonly crewmates will try and guess who the imposters are and get rid of them. \\nWhen a crewmate’s body is found, a meeting is called, where everyone gets to chat using text boxes – these are only available during meetings, there is no way to communicate otherwise. If a character is thought to have been behaving suspiciously, they are deemed ‘sus’, a vote on their assumed guilt is held and if they are guilty they are thrown out (with usually fatal consequences). \\nBut the game is not over for you if you are dead. Instead, you become a ghost, invisible to everyone except other ghosts – and you can carry on working your way down your list of tasks to do, helping the other crewmates get that little bit closer to the finish line!   The Nitty Gritty \\nThe game has a top-down perspective and fairly crude animations, but is a very compelling game because you can go in and out as you like, playing for hours, or just jumping in for a few minutes. To prevent frustration on the part of other players, when you quit in the middle of a game, all your tasks are marked complete. \\nCharacters’ field of vision is a limited cone, which means that the player can see more than the character which just adds to the fun. The other way of winning is to find and eliminate all the imposters – once the last one is uncovered the game is over. \\nImposters can win too, if their sabotage is not uncovered before time runs out, or by reducing the number of crewmates to equal or less than that of the imposters. But don’t worry about secret sabotage going undetected – as soon as something nefarious is done, there is a reaction that is noticed ship-wide, such as the lights all going out or the doors all closing, so, crewmates can get to work finding the issues!   What’s the Appeal?\\nThe big selling point of the game is the chat. Players are positively encouraged to trash talk each other, so instead of trolling being an unpleasant reaction from someone who has lost or who is trying to provoke others, it is openly part of the game!  \\nThis makes it surprisingly funny and entertaining, and it is all the more so because each game will play out differently with new players making entirely new assumptions, insults and accusations. There is something fiendishly hilarious by responded with wounded pride that you are new to the game and trying to work it out, to an accusation of being ‘sus’.

              " Document(page_content=': 324\\nname: Tales Of Arise\\ndescription: Tales of Arise for PC is a Japanese role-playing game (JRPG), the seventeenth in the Tales series, and is touted both as something of a comeback and a reinvention for the long running series. The well-loved battle system – known rather clunkily as the Linear Motion Battle System – remains untouched though, to the delight of enduring fans of the franchise.   About the Game\\nOne of the previous games, Tales of the Graces is thought to be a major inspiration and this has infused this game with an emphasis on evasion and countering, which means that finesse has priority over brute force in combat.  \\nIn the game, two neighbouring planets are locked into a centuries-long period of uneven exploitation. The one planet: Dahna, is medieval and simple, with little in the way of technology and an emphasis on the rural and natural.  \\nBut the thorn in Dahna’s side is Rena, which is bursting with technological superiority, which the people of Rena have wasted no time in using to their own advantage. Some 300 years before the beginning of the game, Rena has enslaved the people of Dahna and also begin to freely help itself to the region’s resources. The game begins in the slower paced Dahna, but moves to Rena, providing you with plenty of chances to explore the worlds.     The Nitty Gritty\\nIn this iteration of the game, there is no multiplayer. The developers did this on purpose, as they wanted to concentrate on the AI characters and their interactions with the players. Their aim is to create a more seamless and real-feeling AI team who will actively help you without dumbing down the game in any way – a careful balance that has largely been achieved. \\nThere are hugely improved graphics in this game compared to the others in the franchise, with an immersive cinematic look to the game play. This is thanks to the dramatic improvements in character models and movement which has been achieved by painstaking mocap (motion capture) work with the voice actors. \\nIn the game, chests conceal weapons, and you can help yourself to tomatoes, meat and other foodstuffs. It is a calm and relatively undemanding game, which will not let you stab things that are not your enemies – for example, you won’t be able to break the fence or poke your sword into the farmed creatures (sort of rabbit-eared pigs!) that are found widely throughout the game.   \\nHowever, this changes when you come across some enemies: at this point the violence that you can wreak, and general excitement level of the game ramps up nicely! You play in a team, in which you have control over one of the party, while the others operate on AI autopilot. You can choose which character you will play as before each battle, but you cannot swap during combat, so choose wisely before you commit! \\nThree of the AI team-mates will fight alongside you, while the other two wait on the side-lines to unleash their special moves – and there are a lot of these! As well as the Mystic Artes, previously seen in other games, good battle moves beget more powers and superpowers so you can enjoy the mayhem.  \\nMake sure you feast on the power-boosting blue crystals before unleashing your turbo-powered self on the unwitting enemy using the new Booster powers. When moving around, you can jump and swim as well as the more usual walk and run.     Who’s Who\\nThe six protagonists team up to achieve their mutual aims and travel in a band working together. You can choose to play as any one of them:   Alphen, is a slave from Dahna who’s lost his memory, and is a young man with a flaming sword (called Sincleaver) and an eye-patch. He cannot feel pain  Shionne, is a young woman (a gunslinger with attitude) from Rena, who has ‘thorns’ (a condition that causes pain to anyone who touches her – which makes Alphen pretty unique in her life) Rinwell a happy-go-lucky mage Law, a young boy and martial arts enthusiast Kisara: a soldier and shield bearer Dohalim il Qaras: best described as a posh fella with lance, until you get to know him better \\nTales of Arise for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 347\\nname: Little Nightmares II\\ndescription: Little Nightmares II for PC is a puzzle platformer horror adventure, a fitting sequel to the original game. The player takes on a new persona for this game – a little boy, called Mono, wearing a paper bag on his head – while Six, the previous games’ protagonist is a computer controlled character in this sequel.   About the Game\\nThis game occurring some unnameable time after the events of the first game, we first meet the small boy, complete with his paper bag mask, in a creepy forest which is fittingly, all in shades of grey and monochrome. The little boy makes his way through the forest – and watch out for traps right from the beginning! – and makes his way to an even creepier forest, where he seems to instinctively know to avoid The Hunter, a rather ugly dude with bad things on his mind. \\nMono creeps into the Hunter’s cottage and frees Six, and together they flee, discovering along the way that everyone in the world, or so it seems, is now completely addicted to their television screens. It is easily established that this is due to the Thin Man who is transmitting a hypnotic signal from the Signal Tower, and the game is on: get to the Signal Tower and smash the transmitter. \\nBut of course, this is much easier said than done, and before the plucky pair can make their way to Pale City, where the Signal Tower stands tall and menacing, they must work their way through the Wilderness, escape the School, shudder through the Hospital and various other sinister locations. \\nAll around, they see signs that the Thin Man does not take well to having his plans interfered with: bags of corpses litter the landscape, rock falls threaten to end the game immediately and bear traps are lying under a deceptively pretty layer of fallen leaves.  Perfect for Fans and Newbies\\nFans of the series will find it delightfully recognisable, while newcomers will be able to slide right in without having any sense of not knowing what is going on. Bring your best puzzling mind to bear on each level, each of which is differently themed around a certain monster or environment – such as the opening scene’s forest.  \\nYou will need to be stealthy too, in order to get some peace to solve the puzzles, so don’t go blundering around too much! The game is grotesque rather than gross, with a slow accumulating build-up of the shudders, rather than a reliance on jump-scares.  Character List\\nThere are a lot of characters, both neutral and hostile in the game – see if you can spot the following who are deserving of special mentions. But watch out for the others too!  Mono – our small boy protagonist, who wears a fetching paper bag on his head Six – a computer character in this game, the protagonist of the original Little Nightmares game, and Mono’s gaming buddy The Hunter – the first villain we meet The Teacher – the stuff of every unhappy schoolchild’s literal nightmares, this teacher is no sweetheart to be consoled with an apple. She has a snake’s head – and that’s just the start of it! Creepy Doll-headed Children – the charges of the Teacher they will attack you. The upside is that their little porcelain heads shatter beautifully, once you work out how to do it! The Thin Man – the main protagonist and sure to give players of a certain age horrendously goose-bumpy Slenderman vibes\\nLittle Nightmares II for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 364\\nname: Generation Zero\\ndescription: Generation Zero for PC is a post-apocalyptic game set in an alternative reality Sweden in 1989, when killer robots have overrun the world. Play is from a cooperative first person shooter perspective and is set in an open world that positively invites exploration.  About the Game\\nThe game’s graphics are beautiful and have been compared to the artworks of digital artist Simon Stalenhag although both the artist and the game developers have said that this is an accidental coincidence.  \\nPlayers can choose their ‘type’ as a character, with choices defining him or her as a ‘jock’ or a ‘nerd’ or a ‘punk’ – whichever your 80s vibe feels most comfortable with! While it is clear that your mission is to find out what happened and who caused the invasion as well as looking for survivors, should there be any, you are not tied to following a strict progression. \\nYou can choose your own path, exploring the world in your own time and following the story as and when you choose to. This makes for a more dynamic gaming experience as you can perform those tasks that interest you, rather than being funnelled along a tight story arc with no time or leeway to explore. \\nThe way gameplay is set out actively encourages this. There are no map markers to aim for: instead you explore your environment and engage with it, discovering map fragments, or short missions which, when complete, give you a hint about what to do next – when you feel like it!  Ways to Play \\nSingle player involves the player taking on the persona of a Swedish teen returning home after a trip away, only to find that his home has been taken over by the killer robots. He seeks to avoid their lethal attentions even as he battles to find out what happened to his family. \\nIn cooperative play, the player can team up with three friends – or strangers – to work together to uncover the mystery of what happened to the inhabitants of the house. As always, this provides a great opportunity for camaraderie and banter as you work together to defeat the machines and solve puzzles to find information.  Fun Facts About the Game The game designers based the location on their own childhood memories of playing in the Swedish forests. This gives the game’s setting an eerie realism as well as a spectacularly sinister vibe instantly recognisable to anyone who played in such surroundings as an imaginative child when a monster could lurk behind every tree There are six different kind of robots – most of them lethal, but some more so than others! See if you can get them all in one game Husband your ammunition is a key tip. While loot is reasonably plentiful, it is still very possible for the unwary to run out of ammo, leaving them at the mercy of the mechs, as the killer robots are known, until they can restock Use one of the massive 80s-style boomboxes as bait. Mechs are always curious about noise and you can leave one playing as you set up an ambush for them. Or, if you are about to be trapped, you can lob one off to the side and make a sneaky escape as your assailants run off to see what all the commotion is about The more advanced robots have armour: if you can damage or remove the armour, the robots are much easier to knock out of commission\\nGeneration Zero for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 369\\nname: Monster Hunter Rise\\ndescription: Monster Hunter Rise for PC is an action adventure game, the sixth main game in the Monster Hunter series. This game has taken the best bits of the previous five games to offer a distillation of everything that fans love about the game. As always, the player is the eponymous hunter, tasked with capturing or killing large creatures.   About the Game\\nThe story begins with your graduation from the Monster Hunter academy. You are immediately taken to Kamura Village and filled in on the back story, which is that there has not been a monster outbreak or attack for about fifty years in the Village. But the signs are ominous that a ‘Rampage’ is about to occur, so you and your fellow hunters must prepare as best you can – with some help from the old hands, of course.  \\nAs a newly qualified hunter, being prepped for the coming Rampage, you must complete a series of quests to ensure that you and everyone else will survive what is coming. There are a number of useful tools to use, some of which are innovations in this game.  \\nFor example, the Wirebug grapple tool helps you to move fast and easily. Wirebugs are little beetles, and it is the female of the species which is useful to Hunters. They are essentially a recharging resource that let you jump through the air, scale any wall, help you recover from big hits, and so on. \\nWirebugs’ powers also pair up with special Silkbind moves, which are powers that use the silk produced by the Wirebugs themselves. This silk can be used to tether rideable monsters, climb higher and so on. It’s hard to overstate just how much you will use your Wirebugs as they influence the pace of the game both in and out of combat, bringing extra power to your conventional weapons in the heat of battle for even more exciting contests. \\nThere is a huge cast of monsters to hunt, capture or kill. There are at least thirty different beasts, of whom ten are unique to this game: try to get them all, whether it is the fruit throwing Bishaten who looks like a bird-monkey hybrid; stylish Aknosom, the fire crane; or the immense platy-turtle Tetranadon who seems to have been inspired by the Japanese art of sumo.  \\nWith each monster, you can reduce them to a biddable state, by inflicting damage upon them. At this point, you can indulge in a spot of Wyvern Riding – or using that monster as your steed to take down other monsters! \\nThe map is seamless with no divisions between regions or areas, and as the name implies, verticality is key – learn to go up. When you are scaling cliffs, walls and mountains, you can continue the main business of the game: killing monsters! Killing monsters scores you loot (usually monster parts), from which you can craft bigger weapons and better armour so you can take on bigger and more powerful beasts.  \\nYou’re not alone in the game, you have a Palamute (a pal who is a malamute dog) who is both an AI companion and a fast travel mode all in one. You can ride on your Palamute to save your stamina when travelling across the map, and they can also climb well and help you attack monsters to double your gains.  \\nPalamutes join Palicos in the roster, the latter being cat-like humanoid companions from the previous Monster Hunter games – whoever names new characters has not improved their punning levels in all this time…  The Nitty Gritty\\nThere are various ways to play: single player, local multiplay, and online multiplay. In single play, you can choose two companions from any combination of Palamute and Palico as you prefer. \\nThere is also a survival mode, neatly called Rampage, where you must defend a village from a never-ending horde of monsters that just keep on coming. This feels like a tower defence mode, which teams well with the regular gameplay as a way to mix things up. \\nThe graphics look great having been heavily inspired by Japanese mythology and medieval feudal culture. The gameplay is crisp and snappily responsive, which is what you need in a game such as this which depends on speed and precision. Making these moves is a positive pleasure thanks to the highly responsive game, not the torture it can be with games that lag at just the wrong moment to let the villains catch up with you.  \\nAs you progress to High Rank (the super hard levels), it is not just you who gets better at fighting more monsters, the scenery becomes tougher to traverse, the enemies become more cunning, better at fighting and generally continue to keep you on your toes. But the rewards are also suitably boosted, so that’s a fair trade for most players!  \\nThere are rewards for navigating about the map which are a nice bonus given that you get all the fun of poking around the edges of the game. You can play through the story arc, or take your time and complete all the side quests as you go, the choice is yours. If the Nintendo version of this game was good, the PC version is even better, with smoother action and truly cinematic visuals.  Types of Weapons To Try\\nThere are fourteen types of weapons within the game, and you can try them all, improving your skills and stats the better you get. Some of the weapons are unconventional, which adds to the fun of the game!  Swords: straight-forward and easy to use: hold the hilt and stick it into the villain! Shields: hide behind them, throw them at unwary enemies, think of other ways to use them Staves: similar to swords but less sharp! Essentially long sticks, staves can be used to devastating effect once you have mastered how to use them Bows: keep out of harm’s reach and pick off the enemy, one by one Guns: like bows, guns are great for sniping, but you won’t have long after the first shot rings out before the monsters are running away or hunting you down Hunting horn: toot this horn for some sonic damage – blast your enemies into disorientation with this one Noxious toads: make the attacking monsters feel ill and back off for a moment, giving you time to run in with a sword, or take your best shot\\nAnd many more!  \\nMonster Hunter Rise for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/7893/pcover/7893.jpg?v=1710251025', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 369}),\n",

For more than 20 years, 3DMark has been the first choice for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance. \\nThere'll always be a new game that demands more performance from your hardware. And there'll always be new hardware that delivers more performance for your games. And so the cycle continues. Welcome to 3DMark, the Gamer's Benchmark. \\n3DMark includes everything gamers need to benchmark and compare PC performance. It has dedicated tests for all types of PC from lightweight laptops to dedicated desktops. 3DMark will recommend the best benchmark for your hardware. \\n3DMark tests your system's GPU and CPU performance by rendering extremely demanding game-like scenes in real time. The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score? \\nStart by comparing your 3DMark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware. \\nUpdate your drivers. Update Windows. Experiment with system settings. See how much more performance you can get from your system. Run 3DMark after every change to track your progress. Identify bottlenecks in your system and compare 3DMark scores to help choose your next upgrade. Ask for advice, share tips, and show off your system in the 3DMark Community Hub on Steam. \\nOverclocking is an art that takes skill and precision. The goal is to squeeze every drop of performance out of your GPU and CPU. The reward is a free performance upgrade and the satisfaction of pushing your hardware beyond its stock performance. \\n3DMark is an essential tool for overclockers. Run 3DMark before and after overclocking to measure the performance gain. Use custom benchmark settings to explore your PC's performance limits. Make 3DMark tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings. \\nRun 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your overclocks and the effectiveness of your cooling. 3DMark Stress Tests run in a loop to put your system under heavy load for longer than a standard benchmark run. \\nChallenge your friends to set the highest 3DMark score or compete for the top spot in the 3DMark Steam leaderboards. \\nIf you love PC gaming, there's nothing better than building your own custom PC. And if you build it yourself, there's nothing more nerve-racking than turning it on for the first time. Will it boot? Will everything work properly? Whether you're building a complete system from scratch or upgrading a component, 3DMark has you covered. \\nRun 3DMark and compare your benchmark score with similar systems to make sure your new build is set up correctly. Detailed hardware monitoring charts show you how the CPU and GPU load, temperature, and clock speed changed during your benchmark run—ideal for identifying configuration issues. \\nUse 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your system and discover faulty hardware while it's still under warranty. Stress testing is also a great way to test and optimize your system's cooling performance. A well-built PC with decent cooling should be able to deliver peak performance for the full duration of a 3DMark Stress Test. \\n3DMark can help when you are planning an upgrade as well. Search and compare benchmark results from all the latest graphics cards and processors on the 3DMark website to find the models that offer the best performance for your budget. \\nPC gaming never stands still and neither does 3DMark.

Rem can cook up a health-boosting feast with ingredients found throughout the world, while Bam can craft new weapons and armors from special blueprints you’ll uncover… if you look hard enough. And then there’s Dug, who’ll update you about new quests available throughout the Kingdom.

You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels!     \\nInspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.    \\nSkating and pulling off the best lines in the best spots is one thing, but if no one is there to film it, it didn't really happen… In Session: Skate Sim, you can film with a 1990s filter or fisheye lens, and you can use the video editor to create your clips and share them. You can play with multiple options, including changing the field of view, time of day, filters, and different camera views (tripod, orbit, etc.). Session: Skate Sim also offers the chance to go from skater to filmmaker: pull off your moves then go into film mode to experience the action from the point of view of your camera operator and create the best clip.    \\nShow off your style with an extensive customisation system for your skater and skateboard. By completing challenges, you earn money to spend in skate shops. You can find nearly 200 items (hoodies, shoes, caps, T-shirts, trousers, etc.) from top brands, such as Fallen, Zero, GrindKing, Thankyou, HIJINX Net, Antilanta, Roger Skate CO, No-Comply, iDabble and others. You can also customise your skateboard with over 250 parts, such as wheels, trucks and many other components from famous brands like, No-Comply, GindKing, Thankyou and many others. In addition to the design aspect, the components (trucks, riser pads, wheels…) impact the way you skate. Find the right ones for your style and shred the most iconic spots!\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/5735/pcover/5735.jpg?v=1710512292\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 384}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 390\\nname: It Takes Two\\ndescription: It Takes Two for PC is an action adventure game from developers Hazelight – who also created the similar but unrelated BAFTA-award winning A Way Out – and published by gaming giant EA Games. It is a two player co-op game.  About the Game\\nThe game must be played in co-operative mode, either in online co-op or with a friend in the same room, as there is no possibility to play by yourself. There is no single player mode because, as the title strongly hint, it takes two! However, you can invite a friend to join you for free if you get a Friends Pass, so your gaming is not much affected.  \\nThe very basic premise of the story is that a couple (Cody and May) have grown apart and lost their sense of fun and adventure along with the spark of their love for one another. But then, something – a large mysterious magically explosive occurrence – sends the two spiralling through time, space, and possibly even dimensions – who knows? – and transforms them into, variously, clay figures, knitted dolls, wooden puppets and more.  \\nEach of the various guises gives them certain advantages and disadvantages that they must learn to use, but what is needed more than anything else is teamwork. The couple are guided in their mission by the very wordy Dr Hakim (see below). Dr Hakim is eager for the couple to find their way back to their real selves and each other, with the emphasis definitely on the latter over the former!   More Information\\nDespite the slightly cheesy (you’ll love it, really!) storyline, the gameplay is compelling and the game’s mechanics are, the creator confidently says, more than enough to be world record breaking. And he should know, he’s worked hard on the project for years!  \\nWhen you begin you are looking at a solid fourteen or fifteen hours of content, so make sure you have plenty of time and no commitments so you can play right through – the game will grab you and hold your attention! You will battle, climb and even fly through weird and wonderful landscapes as you move from level to level, trying to find your ways home. \\nCloser study reveals that the couple are actually the MC’s parents (the MC is glimpsed briefly in the beginning, before the magical explosion) and the multiple scenarios they have to work their way through have a certain charming ‘child’s bedroominess’ combined with – well – the entire universe! See how many levels you can identify as you play through!  \\nFor fans of A Way Out, there are some similarities: having to work together, not being able to succeed alone, the offer of a Friend’s Pass so you can play with a real life friend – but there are probably more differences: two escaped prisoners doing what they can to survive is a whole world away from a mom and dad learning to work together!  Character Study Cody – the male of the hetero-couple who needs to learn to listen to May, show his emotions sometimes, and not try and fix everything with brute force. He can keep the dad jokes flowing though! May – the female of the pair. She begins the game dispirited and depressed, but gradually finds her agency and her voice, remembering the person she really is Dr Hakim – a talking book who loves the sound of his own voice and whose cover declares him to be a love story, the tutorial, instruction manual and provider of a decent amount of exposition and comedy in more-or-less equal measure MC – we gradually realise that the couple are the MC’s parents and this helps us to realise the meaning behind many of the game levels\\nIt Takes Two for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/7154/pcover/7154.jpg?v=1710167299', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 390}),\n",

About the Game\\nYou play as a revenant, awakening in the remains of a city called Vein. You are guided by a girl, dressed all in white, called Io, who serves as instruction manual, map and guide for the first few moments of gameplay.  \\nThe game is large open world, although there are many doorways which only open one way, so a player must be satisfied that they have unlocked all the secrets and discovered all the hidden power-ups, treasures and so on in one area before moving on to the next.  \\nThe ending is equally open-ended, with several endings depending on how well the game was played. If the Revenant has been very successful, and brought many comrades along to the final scenes, it plays out one way, whereas if few have survived, or if the Revenant is alone, then a different scenario plays out.  Facts about Revenants\\nRevenants, being something like zombies, but with significant differences, are brought back to life by having a parasitic organism attached to their hearts – think something like a creepy and fleshy pace-maker – and can thenceforth only be killed if their hearts are destroyed. \\nRevenants do not need or crave brains, instead – this is where the vampiric bit comes in – they need human blood for nourishment and fend off the advent of mindlessness. Revenants that do not get a sufficient supply of human blood become subject to a frenzy that transforms them into cannibalistic beasts that cannot be reasoned with.  \\nIn order to ensure a plentiful supply of nutrients for Revenants, there are Bloodspring plants which produce Blood Beads – a sort of ready meal for Revenants. However, of late, production of Blood Beads has begun to fall, so more Revenants are threatened with becoming Frenzied, as it is known.  Intensely Detailed Avatar Building\\nThis game has seriously pushed the boat out when it comes to building your playing character. Settle in and be prepared to spend a good long time perfecting every single detail about your character in a way that you have seldom seen before.  Hair colour: you can not only choose any colour under the sun for your character’s hair, but once you click on the colour – say, green – you get a slider with hundreds of shades of green so you can very precisely choose the exact shade of marine turquoise with a hint of petit pois that you want your character to sport Hair style: as with the colour, there are hundreds of styles to choose from, and once you have selected one – say, medium-length pony-tail with a loose curl, parting on the left with some soft spikes on top (yes, they are that detailed!) you can then tweak it for fullness by adding more hair, trim the length slightly, fatten or thin out the ponytail, and add a number of other tweaks besides Eye details: as well as the usual eye shapes and colours, with this game you have more of both of those options, as well as choices about eyelash length and colour, pupil size and shape – lime green almond-shaped eyes with a vertical cats-eye pupil? Easily done! Clothing trim: not only can you choose the character’s wardrobe, picking out tailoring and colouring to suit, you can lengthen, shorten or completely remove collars, add buckles and straps as needed and perform any of a number of sartorial tweaks that will make your avatar stand out from the Revenant crowd Scars: that’s right, you can add scars to your playing character, aligning it the way you like, making it bigger or smaller and placing it precisely where you want it to go, so you can make up a compelling backstory for the character and give them scars to fit their story!\\nCode Vein for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

The game is set in an open world called Palm City, which is heavily inspired by Florida, complete with wide Miami-like tree-lined avenues and a sea-side, beach vibe that gives the game a hint of holiday vibes.  About the Game\\nThe player must cruise about the city, exploring the open world and seeing what there is to see – at least by day. There are legal street races during the day, and if you win you will make money at these games. Your two day time activities are exploring and racing, and both of these are completely legal, so feel free to poke around and see if you can find any hidden secrets. \\nOnce you have had enough of the more vanilla side of life, you can trigger sundown and voila day turns to night, opening up a whole different world of opportunity and risk. \\nAt night the races are no longer legal, and the stakes are considerably higher. You are no longer racing for cash, you are racing for ‘rep’ which is reputation, or basically, street cred. The more rep you have the higher your heat goes, and the higher your heat goes (all the way from one to five) the more ‘wanted’ you are, by the police. \\nHowever, the higher your rep goes, disregarding the police attention for a moment, the more goodies, boosters and even higher quality vehicles you are able to unlock, making a little bit of uncomfortable attention from the police a seemingly minor detail.  What About My Rides?\\nThe vehicles look and perform like magic, and you can enhance both of these features by popping to a garage and spending both rep and cash in order to upgrade the external appearance of the car and the internal engine, upgrading speed and performance to the max. \\nAnd they will be worth spending money on: Mercedes, Ferrari, Porsche and McLaren are just a few of the impressive one hundred and twenty-seven (127!) vehicles that are fully customisable and playable in the game. \\nThere is an app attached to the game which allows you to work on customising your vehicles while out and about, sending the finished car to the game, so it is ready and waiting when you are back home and itching to get racing in your newly refurbed speed machine.  Watch Out for the Police They will get you in the daytime if you speed or otherwise break the law. They cannot stop you from racing during the day and earning cash, but any other infractions will attract their attention before you can say ‘Can I help you, Officer?’ They might ‘accidentally’ ram you if you start winning too many races and cashing in a bit too readily. Not for any real reason, just to keep you on your toes! At night, they are out to get you, and as all your races are illegal after dark, they have the right to detain and arrest you – which kind of ruins your reputation as a sick racer Should they catch up to you when you are holding a lot of rep and cash, they will remove it from you, leaving you broke and discredited. Get around this by popping to a safe house every so often, to stash your loot, whether it is ill-gotten or honestly obtained!\\nNeed for Speed Heat for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

About the Game \\nSet on an imaginary planet called Kerbin, cartoonish aliens, Kerbals, have shown a wonderful proficiency at spacecraft design and interplanetary flight. Players work with their Kerbals to design a working rocket, rover, aircraft or spaceplane using the set number of components. \\nOnce the vehicle is complete, you can begin testing it, starting with a launch. Launching will go wrong for the slightest error in your design and calculations: you can fail to break free of the atmosphere, have too heavy a rocket or too explosive a design, or it can all work perfectly: except you run out of fuel before you can make a safe landing and have to watch all your hard work spiral remorselessly to smash itself on the ground. \\nBecause of the difficulty in getting the science right, simply achieving what in most other games is just the beginning, before the ‘real’ adventure can start, that is to say, a successful landing in your newly built spaceship, can feel like a real achievement. As, in fact, it is! \\nThe whole premise of the game is building and flying spaceships and rockets into space, but this simple description belies the vast expenditure of effort that goes into getting everything just right. \\nIf this all sounds a bit alarming, don’t panic: there is an extensive tutorial that has been expanded and improved since the game’s initial release that will get you going on the first baby steps towards rocket building. The tutorial doesn’t exactly make the game easy, it just eases you on your way!  Three Modes of Play Sandbox: With an unlimited budget, full access to all the ship parts and a vehicle assembly building in which you click to select a part, and click again to place it where you want it. Repeat until you think your rocket (or other vehicle of your choice) is complete and then click launch to test it out. From there, the world is your oyster: you can explore nearby moons, distant planets or head back to the lab to build another experimental rocket ship! Science: With this mode, you are limited as to budget and resources, and must develop your skills while being restricted and restrained. It is a fun way to test your ingenuity: seeing how to create the biggest, best, most functional rocket that you can without going over your budget and managing your time to conduct the experiments that earn you science credit and enable your budget and resources to be expanded a little more Career: This is more of a role playing version of the game in which you must manage not only the science but your employees and overheads too. You must complete contracts (like missions) in order to earn reputation points. Having a good reputation will bring you some money and even more contracts. As you work through the contracts, you cannot ignore the building which needs upgrades – completing these will get you more work, and so on\\nKerbal Space Program for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 420\\nname: Tribes of Midgard\\ndescription: Tribes of Midgard for PC is an action role playing game (ARPG) survival game very loosely based on Viking mythology. If you are looking for something fun with a vague theme, this is the game for you – serious students of the Norse tales might need to look elsewhere. The game features elements of rouge like play – each time you’re wiped out you lose what you are carrying, but you get season XP which accumulate steadily.  About the Game\\nYou play as a fallen Viking warrior – one whose soul has been collected by his Valkyrie and carried off to Valhalla – called an Einherjar. Instead of carousing and fighting all the time, you have been given a new duty: to protect the seeds of Yggdrasil from Helthings, dark elves, trolls and giants who want to destroy them, and perhaps the tree itself.  \\nThe game is very fast-paced and fairly unforgiving. In saga mode, you have about two hours to complete your mission before the endless winter (Fimbulwinter) arrives and puts an icicle in all your plans.  \\nBy day you’ll complete missions, but at night you must return to the hub to defend it from Hel’s minions. However, once permanent winter arrives, there are no more days, so you must work exceedingly fast!  \\nHuge creatures called Jotnar (many Jotnar but one Jotunn) seem to be laughable enemies, large, lumbering and slow, but they have a huge health pool, so you must start chipping away at them promptly, lest they make it to your stronghold and do serious damage before you can bring them down.  \\nSouls are currency, gathered from fallen enemies – and big ones like Jotnar make you seriously wealthy! You will use souls to save the tree, upgrade your village and the craftsmen, earn better items from vendors, and repair structures like bridges and walls. You will lose souls if you die, so keep track at all times and ‘bank’ them when you can.  \\nGather resources as quickly as you can, and use tools to do so, if necessary. You need to keep upgrading everything all the time in order to cope with the increasing difficulty of the game, so you must spend your precious time wisely. For example, choose, when you can, where you want an enemy to fall – they can bring down trees etc so you gain all the resources from the enemy and the tree in one move.  \\nWatch the moon – every now and then a blood moon gives you a hard time with extra-tough enemies – but the next night no enemies come to harass your village, so if you are wanting more time exploring/ to go further on the map/ or need to gather night time resources, that is the night to choose. Fenrir is the final boss of the game. He is a child of Loki and Angrboda, a snaky sort of woman. He is tough to beat, as you might expect. \\nEnemies cluster in camps as well as seeking you out and raiding their camps can yield nice amounts of loot – the bigger the camp, the more loot you get.  \\nIn this game you must play hard and fast from the very beginning – unlike in other survival games there is no cushion of a day or so while you get used to your location and work out how to craft and gather resources – it’s all go from the moment you start the game!  The Nitty Gritty\\nYou can play solo or co-op in groups of ten. That is to say, you can play solo, but the game is really intended to be co-operative as there’s just too much for one player to cope with easily for very long. Instead, in a group of ten friends things are much easier and more enjoyable.  \\nThe game has a strong element of time and resource management, and you must learn to grab stone and wood as quickly as you can, level up NCP craftsmen as expediently as possible, and decide how and where to deploy the precious resources you find and craft. \\nThere are two modes of play, saga mode (which is basically story mode) and survival mode (which is essentially ‘endless play’). There are eight gameplay classes (ranger, warrior, berserker, warden, seer, guardian, sentinel, and hunter), each with unique combat properties to master and choose between.  \\nShrines are everywhere, and once activated they help you fast travel to and from the village. The war chest keeps your inventory safe even if you die so check back in every now and then, even if it costs you time! \\nWater is lethal to you – and to your enemies too! At every opportunity, shove ’em in the water if they seem to be gaining the advantage over you! \\nIt is a good idea to keep an eye on the noticeboard so you know what missions are going and how many you can do while you go about your business. Everything you do chews into your time, so learning to multi-task and working especially quickly is a must. \\nIn multiplayer mode, you can come and go for 3 game days, after which the game locks you in – you can exit through the Bifrost, but you can’t come back until much later, assuming the game is still ongoing.  Where To Go?\\nThere are five biomes to play through, each holding unique resources so you will end up exploring them, whether you intend to or not!  Bright Forest: the default location, it is lush and temperature, green with trees, full of lots of resources, and easy to play Land of Pools: sogginess awaits! Ash Beach: swimsuit not necessary… Glacier Peaks: freeze on a mountain in the name of fun! Smoky Highlands: if you can’t handle the heat, stay away from here\\nTribes of Midgard for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9127/pcover/9127.jpg?v=1666000691', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 420}),\n",

The first-person shooter is set in the middle of WWII, albeit with some (rather a lot of) historical inaccuracies, not least of which is the inclusion of female soldiers.  About the Game\\nThe core game follows three basic stories, one of which the player chooses in order to follow that character’s path through the war. Cosmetic items and weapons upgrades can be purchased using in game currency which can be earned through completing missions, or bought if you are in a hurry to progress through the levels.   Battle Royale\\nJoin in a battle to the death in a restricted campaign called Firestorm. The name comes from the unique feature designed to keep the slaughter ground contained to a relatively small area of the open world format. A literal storm of fire sweeps over and around the battleground killing any who stray into its path – however, nevertheless, this campaign features the biggest game map yet on any Battlefield game. Up to sixty-four players can play the Battle Royale at any one time, and they are organised into battalions of sixteen players initially, with an emphasis on co-operative team play.  Ways to Play Single player\\nChoose one of the game paths which will take you from safety into the midst and battle and, hopefully, safely home again! These stories are based on real life campaigns from WWII although with some added drama and exaggerations to make the game play even more compulsive. \\nThe game is set in the bombed out ruins of Rotterdam, and boasts some wonderful visual treats, such as the wounded Spitfire grazing an already wounded wing against a bell-tower before losing height as it stumbles over the horizon leaving a trail of smoke and dust.  Creation as well as Destruction\\nIt is not all death and destruction though, in certain areas of the map you can build shelters and erect sandbags as a defence against attack. Do look sharp, though, working on your constructions can leave you vulnerable to snipers or ambush from others, so keep a wary eye out while you wait for your progress bar to tick over to complete. \\nYou can play over much of Europe, with many areas in France offering evocative and stunningly depicted locations to battle through and explore.  Multiplayer\\nThere are several multiplayer modes, most of which lay out a brief backstory to give you your incentives. You battle it out with and against many others, in continuous battle modes, working your way through the Grand Operations which simulates real battle campaigns. Towards the end of the session, players are reduced to single weapons with no respawn capability – this feature is called ‘Final Stand’ and marks an exciting and breath-taking culmination of all your combat hours.  Cooperative \\nTeam up with three other players to work cooperatively to achieve the aims of the mission. These missions are dynamic and responsive so you are guaranteed a different experience each time you play. \\nWhichever way you choose to play, you will exult in the game’s stated core pillars of: destruction, team play and vehicles – a glorious mass of shooting, fighting and winning your laurels during the war that displaced ‘The Great War’ as the worst conflict of modern times. \\nBattlefield 5 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

About the Game\\nThe game is set in the bright and pretty fictional town of Brighton, in the equally fictional state of Franklin, in the United States of America (not to be confused with Brighton in the UK which is a seaside town with something of a wild reputation for stage dos and hen parties complete with heavy drinking, drama, and fish and chips!) \\nIn this game, you become a rookie cop in every realistic way – but you are spared the paperwork, which is something! Don’t expect to be enjoying high speed chases, taking down drug barons or doing anything more exciting than writing tickets and telling people to cool it! Doing these day-to-day actions earns you points, and points get you levelled up. And once you have levelled up a bit, then you can start moving into the flashier side of policework.  \\nAs with most non-Sims simulation games, gameplay is soothing, being all about the mundane daily doings of a street officer, with plenty of traffic tickets to be issued, and cars to be towed away. Your focus is on catching speeders, the occasional petty crime to solve and a lot of walking and running – at least until you level up enough to unlock your very own patrol car, which is when you get more exciting calls than mere beat cops are permitted to answer. \\nStop-and-search is a feature, but, unlike in real life, you need a good reason to have become suspicious of the alleged perpetrator. You can also penalise people for littering and jaywalking. There is an intuition system in the game that can help you – or hinder you – in your work, depending on if you are blindly suspicious of everyone or have good observational skills. \\nYou can pull your weapon – you have a taser and a gun – and you can even shoot an unarmed civilian, but do beware of trying this out, or anything else that is not appropriate behaviour for a police officer: you lose any points and upgrades that you had earned that ‘day’ and get booted back to the beginning to start all over again.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe AI controls the traffic and ensures regular violations that need tickets and citations so you will always have something to be doing. Mistakes you make in the game, no matter how honestly intentioned (or not!) – like writing invalid tickets, or crossing the street on red (jaywalking) – will lose you points and slow your progression through the ranks. Ticking all the boxes will see you advancing smartly through the ranks. \\nThe game is under constant development and new districts and new unique neighbourhoods are being introduced all the time, such as Downtown which was the first DLC (downloadable content) following the original release. \\nAnother later addition to the game is the Night Shift, which offers a darker view of the city while honest citizens sleep. The Night Shift has fabulous lighting effects, from your handheld torch to your vehicle’s blue and reds, and it also has a co-operative play ‘buddy beat’ system (called Nightshift with Friends) so you and your besties can explore the city together after dark.  Districts to Explore\\nKeep your eyes open for the following areas and see how people behave differently in the diverse parts of the city.  Brickton: Built up, urban and ever so slightly uptight Downtown: Full of joie de vivre and criminals, you will spend a lot of time here Melting Pot: Diverse, vibrant and proof that bad ’uns can come from anywhere! \\nPolice Stimulator: Patrol Officers is a soothing game showing how correct policing should be done: with the aim of protecting and serving the population.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9062/pcover/9062.jpg?v=1704903494', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 428}),\n",

However, Temtem has features and gameplay that make it a unique and compelling game in its own right.  About the Game\\nPlay through six different lands, each with different terrain and aesthetics, that cover everything from volcanoes to tropical paradises, from crystal-studded caves to sun-drenched savannas. (See below for more about these). There are twelve different types of Temtem, all aligned with various types of terrain – for example, Melee type and Mental type Temtem are found on the island region of Arbury, which is known for being a place of plentiful rain and lush green mountains.  \\nEach player should explore the region they are in, hunting for wild Temtem which must be captured, trained and put to work. These processes are interesting, forming the early levels of the game as the player works to fill his or her stable with wild Temtem – which sometimes resist early efforts to interact with and capture them!  \\nOnce a good number of Temtem have been captured, they can begin their training, which will take them from the bare statistics with which they are caught to maximum levels of strength, health, stamina and speed as well as improvements being wrought to attack and defence levels which make the Temtem stronger and more likely to win battles.  What’s in a Type\\nAs well as Melee and Mental Temtems, there are ten more classifications: Crystal, Digital, Earth, Electric, Fire, Nature, Neutral, Toxic, Water and Wind. These are called Types and which types your Temtem will have depends upon where you find them and how much training they have had.  \\nEach Temtem has two types, and gameplay can be tweaked very precisely depending on how powerful – or not – each Temtem is, compared with its opponents, and sometimes even depending on the Temtem of yours that it has been partnered with. \\nDuring combat, each player chooses two Temtem and between them their four types work together to overcome the talents and skills of the opposing two Temtem. Any Temtem on the winning side, at the end of the battle, will gain experience, which means that you can quickly boost the powers of a weaker, new Temtem, by teaming it with a more experienced Temtem and let the more powerful creature earn points that benefit both of them!   Six Island Regions to Play Through Arbury: A soft green land of rolling hills and gentle mists, with plenty of rainfall to keep the plants green and growing, Arbury is an intellectual’s paradise with a thriving university. From Gothic towns to boggy marshlands, make sure you check out everything that this deceptively simple land has to offer Cipanku: From age-old mysticism to modern technology, this region has transformed itself in recent years, but scratching the shiny digital surface reveals the hidden spirituality below. Things are not all they seem here, so take care not to accept superficial veneers! Deniz: Hot sun, cooling breezes, white sandy beaches and deep aqua seas mark this paradisal island – or is it? Explore the old cities and hidden caves to unearth all of the secrets of this lovely and inviting land! Kisiwa: Split in two by a punishing mountain range, this sunny savanna covered island ranges from semi-arid regions to full-scale punishing desert. Do brace the tunnel diving the halves though, even the most barren places can be teeming with Temtems! Omninesia: Lava caves, luxurious accommodations and an ingenious lift joining the disparate parts of the island make this a fascinating area to explore. Make sure you take an airship to the island, so you see it from above, in all its glory. Tucma: When all is dark, desolate and toxic, what is a Temtem to do? Why, head underground to mine and craft precious objects, of course. The desolation is caused by the island region lying downwind of an active volcano that regularly splatters Tucma with debris: but the underground mining city of Quetzal is thriving and is well worth exploring! \\nTemtem for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 446\\nname: Ghostrunner\\ndescription: Ghostrunner for PC is a hardcore slasher video game, featuring exciting cyberpunk action with lively parkour moves set in a techno dystopia where everyone must have factional loyalty to survive. Poverty and violence abound, and players are the heroes who use all means at their disposal to fight the uncaring authorities, both in their real world and in cyberworld with judicious hacks and careful sabotage.  What’s the Story?\\nWhen the game begins, calamity has already struck and residents (survivors might be a more appropriate term!) are in a carefully balanced battle against the authorities who seek to hoard and control the meagre resources that remain, without caring what happens to the people who are then deprived of said resources. \\nThe basic premise of the game is that you need play through – using your impressive parkour skills and weapons training – humanity’s last city. It is massive, grimy, but striking in its neon-packed urban grittiness, and offers plenty of surfaces, holds, and escape-ways for the cunning traceur or traceuse (that means someone who does parkour).  \\nYour ultimate aim to climb the Dharma Tower, and battle the current Keymaster, Mara, who is a terrible tyrant who is trying to cling to power at all costs. Of course, he has surrounded himself with the best defences available, and you must battle hard to progress. But do not fear, you are super-trained as the game goes on, with your level of training increasing with the difficulty of the villains you will be facing. \\nYou are also not alone in your endeavours. Zoe – a brand new ally – and ‘the Architect’ are your helpers and team mates, giving you advice and missions to complete as you slash and hack your way into the heart of the tower.   Game Mechanics\\nGameplay is fluid and fast moving, and if your character stops they will be caught, so it is best to keep on moving through the city, finding ways at speed from one city block to another. \\nKills only take one hit, so there is no slow and painstaking blow after blow to try and bring down just one enemy, you can hit five or six in a row and see a very primitively satisfying body count – racking up a decent toll of villainous bodies is fine, right? They are the bad guys… \\nWeapons-wise, you have your muscles with an impressive level of athleticism, the force and your katana. Your speed too in a weapon in a way – it is certainly a defence as slowing down allows your enemies to catch up with you, something highly undesirable!   Fun Facts: Game vs IRL Monomolecular Blades: Your blade is monomolecular which means that it has been so thoroughly sharpened that it is a molecule wide on the sharp edge. This, it is said, means that the blade cuts at the molecular level, slicing between molecules instead of smashing into the material – something that would be that steel could be as easily sliced as paper. Near monomolecular blades exist currently, in glass and obsidian, more and more used in surgery, for making clean cuts that do not even need anaesthetic. They are as narrow as 3 nanometres at the sharp edge, while the biggest known molecule (admittedly a man-made one) is 10 nanometres across… Bullet Dodge: You can dodge bullets in the game. Sadly, this skill is not a real life one: if you were far away enough to have time to react, you wouldn’t see the bullet coming, and if you were close enough to see it, it would have hit you before your eyes could track the movement! But you can, if observant and intuitive, react before the bad guy shoots at you, giving a very creditable impression of dodging a bullet! Deflect Missiles: In the game you can bounce missiles back to their senders. This is actually possible in real life, if you can find something that will return the missile without being distorted itself, and if you can do the maths to work out the perfect angle at which to hold your shield or deflector\\nGhostrunner for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 448\\nname: Cyberpunk 2077\\ndescription: Cyberpunk 2077 for PC is a first-person shooter game, but one with a difference. Set in a dystopian Free State of California, the rules of the nation and the state no longer apply. Instead, playing as a mercenary named V, the player must work their way around the city, attaining their goals and battling enemies as they go.   About the Game\\nSeven years in the making, Cyberpunk 2077 looks to be living up to all the hype generated by its introduction at E3 in 2019.  \\nSet fifty-seven years after the table-top game upon which it is based, Cyberpunk 2020, the graphics are exquisitely rendered with characters, scenery and even actions and movements so realistic that they could be mistaken for movie footage. \\nAs you play through the narrative driven game, it is possible to play without killing any other characters, using non-lethal weaponry and strategies that keep you out of serious confrontations of the sort that tend to become lethal. \\nThe game features full nudity, as players are able to upgrade their bodies with modifications that give them extra powers and capabilities, and they need to strip down in order to fit their new limbs and attachments.    New Details\\nOne of the biggest unique selling points of this game is the fact that Keanu Reeves is heavily featured in the game. He plays a character called Johnny Silverhand, who is the lead singer from a band, Samurai, whose songs contain lyrics relevant to V’s state of mind and his life. \\nSilverhand, an original character from the table-top game, is dead in this time, but ‘lives’ in V’s head. This means that the character has more lines of dialogue than any other character save V, who is the protagonist. \\nReeves was a surprise unveiling when the third trailer dropped, and gave the release date to excited fans, keen to get to grips with the latest offering from CD PROJEKT RED, famous for giving us the beloved Witcher games.   Ways to Play Skills: You can play your way through the game, relishing the agility that V has on his or her feet (the character is fully customisable as to clothing, gender, size and so much more), racking up a high kill rate as you dodge from behind walls or vehicles to take down your enemies as quickly and accurately as you can.  Smart Rifle: Using the Smart Rifle is a good way to target your enemy. Simply lock on to their avatar, then send a bullet after them. The bullet will pursue the character until it catches up with them. An efficient way to rid yourself of nuisances while getting on with the rest of your mission.  No Kill: There is no moral code on the game, meaning that you can storm through the game killing anyone and everyone who annoys you if that is the way that you like to play. However, there is no need to kill anyone at all. Challenge yourself to work through the game in a non-violent way, trading and dealing with non-playing characters (known as NPCs).  \\nNPCs are important to the game – take Johnny Silverhand as a case in point – and you can interact with them, befriending and even marrying them. Therefore, the no-kill play method can open up a whole new world for you, introducing you to characters and their backstories in a way that you will not experience should you simply blast them out of your way.   Endgame\\nThere is no fixed aim for the game. Instead V must travel around the city, working to find health points and mods, avoiding or killing villains and generally just living their best life. Think of it as a world away from the real world: somewhere that you can be someone a little different. \\nCyberpunk 2077 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

It is a comprehensive game with a large choice of cars, routes and even distances to choose between.  About the Game\\nThe game begins far from any road or track as you choose and customise your car. There are seventeen vehicles to choose from initially, going up dramatically to high double figures with models from three decades, various classes and sixteen manufacturers, once you have included all the add-ons and expansion packs. \\nOnce chosen, you can spend a fair amount of time and effort improving your choice and designing the perfect rally car of your dreams, with up to ten choices of livery per car. Each vehicle handles slightly differently – not enough for play to become frustrating or tricky, but enough that you will have fun picking the perfect driving ‘feel’ for your ideal rally car. \\nUnlike previous driving games released by the same creators, this game has an entirely new, built from scratch physics engine to provide a realistic and fun, yet moderately challenging drive.  Drive Carefully!\\nYou must try to look after your vehicle in this game because, as tough as rally cars can be, this game has incorporated all the issues and problems that come with real life rallying! This means that your radiator will overheat, exploding dramatically into a cloud of steam if you are not careful to keep an eye on it. \\nPunctures and blow outs happen on poor roads and with rough driving, leaving you eating your opponent’s dust and regretting that over enthusiastic cornering!   Driving Locations\\nThere are a wide number of authentic rallying locations included in the game, all recreated beautifully and carefully so you can try out your favourite tracks without getting into trouble of any kind:  Argolis: in the heart of the Peloponnesian peninsula, this Greek track is set against blue skies, bluer seas and gorgeously sunny terrain Monte Carlo: the heart of speed racing – the entire city shuts down for the Formula One – it is not surprising that rallying goes on here too Powys: a proud ancient kingdom in deep Wales, this area boasts lush green hills, tricky curves and lots and lots of sheep Baumholder: Germany is famous for its speed limit free autobahns, so there is no surprise that speed freaks from all over the world hit these streets to try their luck and test their nerve against fellow adrenaline junkies Jamsa: Finland’s fjords and snowy plains make for an interesting drive and a lively change from clouds of desert dust kicked up by your passage Varmland: Norway’s mountainous and notoriously torturous scenery will keep your adrenaline high and your sweat flowing as you navigate this ancient land, glimpses of outstanding views threatening to distract your attention from the road\\nLater, following an agreement with FIA World Rallycross Championship bigwigs, three more courses were added to the game \\nThese were: namely Holjesbanan a Swedish racing circuit, near the border with Norway and situated in an almost rural locale so you can speed away without worrying about the populace; Lankebanen in Norway, which is near Hell and that is all you need to know about that; and the Lydden Hill Race Circuit from the south of England, near Kent. \\nDiRT Rally for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

What’s the Story?\\nYou and two or three others are drawn together by circumstance, and immediately start working towards the ultimate goal of the game, which is for at least one person to theoretically escape the planet. If everyone dies, the game ends. \\nThere are three types of stranger on the planets as well as events that can be classified with these types: \\nBad: pirates attack your settlement, raiding, kidnapping or killing your people and taking all your stuff. Solar flares strike randomly, damaging your equipment and crops and generally making life harder for a while. \\nNeutral: Nomads wander past your camp but they do not approach or interact with you in anyway. It is mildly reassuring to see them and know that they are there in a pinch!  \\nGood: Fellow survivors who have been wandering around the landscape find your camp and come along to join your team and make themselves generally useful  Things to Think About\\nThis game tackles some of the weirder aspects of time-travel and stasis sleep pods. A woman in her twenties could leave her baby behind, travel for decades without aging, then meet her son who is now twice her age, with a daughter of his own! Mind-boggling to those who like a more traditional family tree!  \\nThe map is dotted about with fun territories, interesting creatures to meet and tame, and even dodgy settlements that you might prefer to avoid – Torture Town sound a good day trip venue to anyone? There are also hidden ancient anomalies that are well worth investigating a little more…  Mental Health Matters\\nThe game starts out, like so many survival games, as being a bit grindy, but it builds up to more engaging fun. The characters have unique psyches makes them act in odd ways: such as, refusing to do certain jobs as beneath them due to aristocratic breeding, not getting tasks done because they can’t read the instructions you left for them and so on!  \\nThe AI storyteller lets you know how you’re getting on. And it’s bound to be badly, because no matter what your intentions are, your colonists have their own ideas and will drive you delightedly mad with their odd quirks and random dislikes! \\nIn this survival game mental health is as important as food and shelter, so time must be found for leisure activities, or even something as simple as a designated place to sit down and eat And it is important: your characters will have psychotic breaks or go into fugues if these needs are neglected! \\nYour colony can advance technologically, but any equipment or vehicle must be constantly maintained and frequently re-fuelled. \\nThe storytellers control the weather, the seasons, your crop harvest, the frequency of newcomers’ arrivals and the advent of catastrophes alike. You can choose from three distinct AI storytellers:  Classic Cassandra, who provides a slow increase of negative events Phoebe Chillax, who offers more positives and plenty of peace, but still gives a challenging game when played on hard mode Randy Random, for whom anything can and does happen at random!\\nRimWorld for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

From the TrueSight system that emulates the units’ line of sight to the cover-system that encourages clever unit placement – not to mention the combined arms approach and the hard and soft counters gameplay that will make you think twice before trying to destroy a tank with a simple squad of riflemen – each game presents players with an uninterrupted stream of meaningful tactical choices that can turn the tide of war. PICK YOUR FIGHTNB: multiplayer standalones allow you to play on any map against anyone owning any COH2 product.  The Company of Heroes 2 base game gives you access to two multiplayer armies from the Eastern Front: the Red Army (SOV) and the Wehrmacht Ostheer (GER). It also comes with a gritty single-player campaign that will give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the series core tenets. Step into the boots of a Soviet commander of the Red Army, entrenched in brutal frontline warfare to free Mother Russia from the Enemy invaders! Adjust your tactics to take into account the brutal weather conditions and wield the might of the Soviet Empire as you smash your way to Berlin.   Company of Heroes 2: The Western Front Armies adds two new factions from the Western Front to the roster of playable multiplayer armies: the Oberkommando West (OKW) and the US Forces (USF). While the former puts you in charge of an aggressive and powerful army with very specialized and elite units – yet in very limited numbers – the latter introduces an expeditionary corps that allows for a variety of approaches and very powerful combined arms tactics, but which inevitably falls a bit short in the heavy armor department.   Company of Heroes 2: Ardennes Assault offers a compelling single-player campaign for the USF faction revolving around the Battle of the Bulge. Engage in a dynamic non-linear campaign across the Ardennes landscape consisting of 18 scenarios, choose between three iconic companies, customize their abilities and bear the consequences of your actions as overall company health persists between missions.

              " Document(page_content=': 495\\nname: MORDHAU\\ndescription: Mordhau for PC is the equivalent of an oldie-timey first person shooter, being instead a first person slash and stabber game! The custom combat system is rooted in some historical techniques and players must dedicate hours to mastering their weapons: pretty much as young men would have had to do daily in the times before modern weaponry.  About the Game\\nThe player can customise quite a lot of their character’s appearance and weapons, with such changes being a mixture of cosmetic and practical. There are three types of armour, with heavier, more durable armour offering obvious advantages, but also working against the player, slowing you down and making your movements more cumbersome. \\nYour character – a mercenary – can be customised quite specifically as to looks so you can spend some time on this, making him look just right for the part. Even his voice can be changed along with his body type and face, so you can get just the right appearance. This customisation costs nothing, but tweaking weapons, armour and other perks will need you to use the in-game currency, so you might need to do a little grinding to get things perfect. \\nYou can learn all about medieval weapons, such as shields, swords, spears, hammers, bows and arrows, and even immense siege weapons that would flatten the average home today! You can occasionally use a horse in your battles, just as knights of old would have done,\\nCombat is achieved through careful and precise movements to parry opponents blows, feint to trick them into exposing a vulnerable part, and to attack them, breaking through their guard and drawing blood. Keep an eye on your health and stamina metres as you go, and on your opponent’s too, so you know when to strike a death blow in dramatic style.  Game Modes\\nThere are a number of different ways to play, namely:  Frontline: this is quite a tactical way to play. Two teams are formed and each team begins with a thousand points. For each enemy killed the opposing team loses a point: for each soldier you lose, you lose a point. You can earn points by winning battles, claiming territory and completing objectives – completing all the objectives triggers an instant win, while winning territory simply depletes enemy points. You will also win if they run out of points Battle Royale: in this, by now familiar, mode, play starts with sixty-four players in one arena. Everyone is naked and afraid: armourless and weaponless, needing to find a chest as fast as possible and gear up. Then it is a death match, with the play area reducing as the numbers decline. The last man standing is the overall winner Horde: stand firm with your teammates against wave after wave of AI enemies. Your health bar will not regenerate during each round, so be sure not to be too careless with your life, but winning the round will restore you to fitness as well as giving you currency with which you can buy armour and weaponry. As above, you begin with no weapons or armour to hand and must battle with your wits until you can suit up Skirmish: this a form of team play in which each player is sort of out for themselves too! If you die in the game, you will only respawn at the end of the round, continuing to play if your teammates bested the opposition. Win seven rounds and your team wins the whole skirmish Deathmatch: deathmatches are almost like jousts, where you challenge one player at a time to battle one-on-one. Once you have beaten them, you move onto the next: so no waves of enemies, and no overwhelming battles, just duel after duel after duel: an excellent way to find out just how good your medieval weaponry skills are. The first player to get to the requisite number of kills is the winner Team Deathmatch: just like the above, except players are divided into one of two teams and the whole team works to outdo the opposition’s number of kills\\nMordhau for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/4495/pcover/4495.jpg?v=1650976379', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 495}),\n",

Soviet authorities established an \\'Exclusion Zone\\' around, but a second explosion hit the reactor in 2006, creating The Zone as we know it – dangerous place, filled with mutated creatures, deadly radiation, and a strange, anomalous energy. The Zone was cordoned off by the military, who would shoot on sight anyone foolish enough to get inside. Year 2012. The Zone is still a dangerous place and a threat to all mankind. Mercenaries, bounty hunters and explorers ventured further and further into the heart of the Zone driven by reports of strange \\'artifacts\\' imbued with anomalous energy. To sell them on the black market or trying to find the \\'truth\\' behind the Zone. Whatever their motivation, over time these individuals - Scavengers, Trespassers, Adventurers, Loners, Killers, Explorers and Robbers - have become known as S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s. You will have to find your own way to survive in the Zone! \\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky \\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is set in 2011, one year prior to the events of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories. With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun. \\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat \\nWith over 2 million copies sold, the new episode of the most internationally successful S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series seamlessly connects to the first part of the Shadow of Chernobyl. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat takes PC gamers once again into the vicinity of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor that exploded in 1986. This so-called \"Zone\" is a highly contaminated area cordoned off by the military and now is combed through by the so-called stalkers, modern fortune hunters, in search of unique artifacts. In the role of Agent Alexander Degtyarev, who is dressed up as stalker, the player has to investigate the mysterious disappearance of five military helicopters and thereby stand one’s ground against the various stalker groups.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/12250/pcover/12250.jpg?v=1709717405', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 498}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 525\\nname: NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139\\ndescription: NieR Replicant for PC is an action role playing game with something of a history. A spin-off from Drakengard – one of many and not the last NieR game – was called NieR. NieR, the western game, was sold in Japanese as, respectively: NieR: Replicant, with a young protagonist, and NieR:  \\nGestalt with an old hero. Replicant has been remade into a Western-friendly game, which goes by the full name of NieR: NieR Replicant ver. \\n1.22474487139… (including the ellipsis!)  About the Game\\nNieR Replicant ver. 1.22474487139… (the number is the square root of 1.5, perhaps to show that it is not the second game in the series, nor a redo of the original, but somewhere between the two?) picks up the story after the fifth ending of the Drakengard, and is temporally located a massive 1,000 years before NieR: Automata, one of the other games in the spin-off series! The protagonists of Drakengard have accidentally introduced magic to this world… \\nResearch and experimentation with that magic has resulted in a number of issues, not least of which is The Black Scrawl which is almost always lethal. When the protagonist’s sister falls prey to the disease, he must set out to find the cure. He is aided in his search by the Grimoire Weiss, a sentient book who has suffered memory loss from trauma at some point in its past. They are joined by various companions as they search for The Sealed Verses, hoping to find a cure. \\nFans of the previous game will love it, especially the delicate touch that has been used to retain the charm and essence of the game while modernising and speeding it all up. There are plenty of familiar sights to make fans feel nostalgic, while newcomers can immerse themselves without feeling left behind. \\nAs well as an engaging storyline, there are satisfying bouts of combat to enjoy. Choose from various swords and spears, try out a fantastic super-punch that is wonderfully satisfying to deploy and use a different combat style for each boss that you go head to head with. Adding to your enjoyment, the soundtrack is superb and really enhances the playing experience.  Villains – and a Warning!\\nThe main villain, who is called Shadowlord, carries his own book, the Grimoire Noir. He kidnaps Yonah early in the game, after which there is a five-year gap. When play resumes, the band of travellers believe that getting their hands on the Grimoire Noire can help them in their task.  \\nA second play through is well worth your time. To speed matters along it begins after the 5-year skip and reveals a lot more information about the characters and the world in which they live – and some of those revelations are an intriguing twist in the tale that explains how Automata will come about.  \\nHowever, do be careful as to which ending you choose should you want to play through three or more times – one ending choice deletes the main character from the other characters’ minds, and also deletes your progress, achievements and leaves the game almost as new, as if it had never been played! You won’t be able to use the same name for your protagonist when you begin again, either.  NieR’s Companions\\nLet us take a look at the heroes of the game.  NieR – Our protagonist, who must go on a quest to find the cure for his sister’s illness before it progresses too far Grimoire Weiss – this tome has suffered some memory loss and doesn’t know his true identity, but this doesn’t stop him from being a bit of a gruff know-it-all, although he is saved from being annoying by his occasionally showing off his silly side, which adds some nice moments of levity to the game Kaine – half-human/ half-shade* and forced into baring a lot of skin to prevent the shade getting access to any more of her body. She is vulnerable but also brash, eating a lot, talking crudely and battling like a brawler (*Shades are bad guys, liking to sneak up on the heroes in the dark, trying to take over their bodies! They are weak in sunlight on only attack in the dark) Emil – a very sweet and shy young boy who lives in a manor with his butler. He seems to have the perfect life except for the power that makes people turn to stone when he looks at them. Having to wear a blindfold to protect the people he cares about; he can also be a bit blind towards people’s finer feelings! Popola – is the town’s librarian: cool, calm and collected. Devola is her sister. Devola – is artistic, and is often found singing near the fountain in the village. Devola and Popola know some secrets that can change everything, if only the hero asks the right questions! Yonah – NeiR’s sister has always been sickly, since birth, but she is very charismatic, drawing people to her. She has contracted the Black Scrawl and this is the inspiration for the whole game!\\nNieR Replicant for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 530\\nname: Orcs Must Die! 3\\ndescription: Orcs Must Die! 3 for PC is an action game heavily involving tower defence. The game is the fourth in the Orcs Must Die! Series and is the direct sequel to Orcs Must Die! 2, picking up the action 20 years after Orcs Must Die! 2 ends. The full series is: Orcs Must Die!; Orcs Must Die! 2, Orcs Must Die: Unchained (perhaps the least successful of the series), and now this one, which aims to return the game to its heyday. And in that it succeeds nicely.    About the Game\\nYou play the character of one of several apprentice mages, who are part of The Order. The Order is a group of wizards and warriors who must use all the weapons and special skills and traps they can to defeat the hordes of orcs that endlessly try to access Rifts. Rifts are openings or portals between this (the human) world and Dead World which is a source of magical energy upon which wizards (and the general population ultimately) rely.  \\nYou must lay out a series of traps in your newly purchased dungeon (or a field, if your fancy takes you that way), aiming to take out as many orcs as you can with the traps. You are aided in this by the flow of ‘ghost orcs’ which show you which way the real orcs will go when they arrive. This helps you to position the traps, so you can aim them to an area where they will do the most damage.  \\nBut don’t make your traps too lethal! Not straight away at least. Getting the orcs to trigger the whole series of traps boosts your combo points nicely and the more traps they trigger, the better for your score card in the long run.  \\nThere is also a level of slapstick hilarity to the orcs triggering of the traps – including overkill types like the brightly coloured acid geyser trap and the saw blade launcher (which can be aimed once you learn the way the bouncing saw blades will ricochet) – they are flung high in the air in a cartoonish way that is quite blood-thirstily satisfying.  \\nThere is some good banter to be overheard between the war mages (of which one tends to be obliviously daft, while the other one is sassy)!\\nConsideration must be given to the way you want to play as your trap inventory and weapons inventory use up the same slots, so you have to choose what to take with you and find the right balance between in person firepower and passive trap setting.   The Nitty Gritty\\nWork through the original 18 levels of story mode, play in endless mode to see how long you can last, or amuse yourself with the Weekly Challenges.  \\nIn this game, there is an oversized arena, where everything is scaled up to war-like proportions – appropriately, it is called War Scenarios. You will face up to 1,000 orcs advancing on you, use and fear immense siege weapons and oversized traps (called War Machines) and generally see if you can cope with everything being supersized! There are five maps set aside for War Scenarios.  \\nScramble is a new (semi rogue-like/ lite mode), which was released after the main game’s release. It is a great way to challenge yourself as you must beat five levels of increasing difficulty. As if that wasn’t hard enough, in between levels, you will find yourself under attack, will lose random buffs and may even find yourself being chased rather than needing to defend a Rift!  \\nHowever, as much as you are dealt random active penalties, there are also new and exciting buffs that boost your existing powers (aka random active bonuses). Scramble only unlocks along with the second story campaign, after you have progressed some way into the main game, so you will have to at least start the main game.  \\nFiring into the crowd is great fun, especially if you set yourself specific targets, or you can use freeze bombs and knockbacks to take out swathes of orcs. There is no real skill needed, just adrenaline boosting button mashing which is really satisfying when you are in the mood for it. \\nMost orcs are green, and come in a range of sizes, but watch out for purple orcs – these are Fire Fiends who are impervious to freezing and to flames. Another nasty creature to look out for are gnoll hunters who would rather get hold of you than get to the Rift.  \\nAs you play, aim for the perfect five-skull score on each map. Mix up your play between traps and combat, letting the traps take out most orcs and then you take care of the rest. The best way to play is with 2 players in co-operative mode, as this allows you to tag team each other, and gives you two pairs of eyes and hands – which can result in double the chance of success!   Traps, Traps, Traps\\nTypes of traps to lay out follow. Remember, you get more points for more damage, so avoid the high intensity quick kills in favour of lengthy drawn-out low damage series of traps, boosting the yield for when you do dispatch them.   Arrow attacks – when the trap is triggered a flight of arrows fly out from the walls Spike pits – open up under the orcs’ feet  Shock traps – blitz the orcs with lightning/ electricity from above, this has the cool effect of showing the orc’s skeleton while the blast is working on them Spring traps - these tilt the orcs into lava pools or meat grinders, so pay attention to the positioning to make the most of them Spinning saw blades popping out of the floor when you walk along is never fun – except the orcs walk over them and score you plenty of points! Flaming coals – keep things hot for the orcs and make them regret attacking you!\\nOrcs Must Die! 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 554\\nname: Stellaris\\ndescription: Stellaris for PC is a 4X real-time strategy game: 4X meaning explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate which refers to the actions taken by the characters in order to achieve the aims of the game, whether they are gathering valuable resources, claiming new territories, or simply kicking enemy butt.  About the Game\\nThere are eight species from which the player can choose, and the strategic thinking should be applied right from the start. Some species are better with some pathways than others: for example, warlike races are unlikely to make good spiritual pacifists just as ethereal beings are unlikely to be able to swing a hefty weapon with any great authority! See more about the races below. \\nThe player joins their species of choice very shortly after the invention of faster-than-light (FTL) travel has dramatically expanded their options. You can choose to be a peaceful explorer, sharing resources and information as you go, or you can be completely blood-thirsty, besting every other being you come across. \\nWhichever way you choose to play, there are pathways to be followed: from building military might to learning farming skills, to playing politics in order to get what you need. For example, you can land on a new planet and take their resources by force, or you can form an alliance or bartering system to get hold of those resources peacefully. \\nAmongst the pathways to be followed and expanded there is science, construction and vehicle building, all of which can help you no matter how militant or pacifist you have decided to be.  Technology is Available: For Some!\\nAI and robotic technology is available, but if you are a pacifist and spiritual species you will not be able to enjoy these. Instead, landing on any planet that already has this technology will see it being dismantled or decommissioned in favour of raising temples and other spiritually relevant buildings.  \\nPolitics comes into play too: authoritarian regimes will not permit democratic elections to be held, while materialistic races cannot bar the creation and sale of robots. As mentioned above, this means that you must make good choices early on in the game in order to enjoy the facets of worldbuilding that you enjoy the most in your game.  A Rundown of Races Arthropoid (insectile): the thought of playing as a sort of giant insect might be unappealing until you think about some of the positives: the endless indestructibility of cockroaches, the beauty (and wings) of butterflies, and even the tank-like structure of a beetle Avian (birdlike): these delicate looking beings pack more punch than you’d think at first glance. And anyway, who doesn’t want to play as a massive penguin or super-powerful platypus?  Fungoid : mushrooms are fun guys. That’s it. That’s all that needs to be said here Humanoid: within the umbrella of humanoid, you can find a wealth of different features, strengths and powers, linked solely by the basic design of two arm, two legs, and a head, all attached to a torso in more or less the same recognisable order. Pick your favourite from the variations on offer, and then train them up your own way Mammalian: play as any of your favourite animals: or even mix and match characteristics from different creatures until you achieve your perfect designer beast Molluscoid (invertebrate): these fascinating creatures will allow you to squeeze into small spaces, hide from enemy eyes and enjoy a whole raft of tricksy traits as you explore the furthest reaches of the galaxy  Reptilian: force aliens to bow down to your crocodilish overlord, recreate the dinosaurs or simply enjoy basking with the might offered by these war-like races Plantoid (this last was added as DLC after the initial release): want to take things slow and chilled? Maybe enjoy some zen meditation? Then a plantoid (meaning of or like plants) is the race you want to be\\nStellaris for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Over the course of the game you join them as they swim, fly, roll and chomp their way to the open ocean from the far-flung corners of Barnardshire (the smallest county in England) in their bid for freedom and to re-unite once again.    FINTASTIC FRIENDS\\nMeet our heroes! Goldfish - cheerful, brave, and adventurous, a natural born swimmer! Pufferfish – a little slow but kind-hearted who can also puff up into a ball and roll across land. Piranha - wild, chaotic, loud, unpredictable, and loves to bite - obviously. Flying Fish – a little aloof at times but a real softy at heart, with the ability to glide through the air! These plucky heroes will leave no bowl unturned, putting their heart and shoal into the mission to re-unite!    NO NEED TO BE A BRAIN STURGEON\\nSwim, roll, glide, chomp, flip flop, inflate, fly and bite your way through enthralling challenges. A simple, intuitive control scheme leaves no excuses should your fish perish leaving you feeling very gill-ty.     THINK OUTSIDE THE BOWL\\nWith its idyllic coastline and quaint villages Barnardshire might seem like a perfect slice of quintessential tranquility, but to our aquatic adventurers it’s alive with the very real threats presented by crossing roads, traversing rooftops, dodging deep fat fryers, avoiding wildlife including the cantankerous locals, not to mention fragile fishbowls and the very real problem that fish can’t breathe out of water.     LEAVE NO FISH BEHIND\\nWe won’t dwell on grizzly fish death, but should your fish fall too far in whatever make-shift fishbowl it finds itself in, run out of air or generally flounder you will be popped back to the most recent checkpoint to refine your approach.    SWIM TO FREEDOM\\nOur four fin-tastic friends will be hitching rides in all manner of ad hoc water carriers including jars, mop buckets on wheels and the occasional pint glass. Cheers! Navigating in each make-shift aquatic vehicle poses its own unique challenge, but don’t worry, the relative freedom of open water is never too far away with inviting fountains, swimming pools and err, sewers full of hazardous materials to splash around in, before reaching the final goal – the shimmering, open ocean.     BE CAREFUL YOU DON’T FLOUNDER\\nWhilst I Am Fish may look like a piece of hake to play, actshoally the controls are deliberately designed to be challenging and with an additional layer of added Bossa Style controls, it won’t be like shooting fish in a barrel. Even if you are a dab-handed player, you might find yourself in deep waters - we dare you to dive in!\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9653/pcover/9653.jpg?v=1705318205', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 555}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 568\\nname: Loop Hero\\ndescription: Loop Hero for PC is an endless RPG, a run-based RPG roguelite, in which an evil lich (animated dead body) has obliterated reality and everything in it. Your job is to run endlessly: powering up, improving your skills and learning what hazards must be defeated in order for you to enjoy success. Unlike some other roguelikes/ lites, this game manages to remain rewarding even as you die time after time!  About the Game\\nThe hero awakens in a small camp and has to rebuild his world, a task in which he is sometimes assisted by other survivors – and sometimes hindered by those who think that everything is helpless and attack him in despair or in an effort to effect their own survival! So don’t be too trusting of all the strangers you meet! \\nYou set off around the route for the first few times, unsure of what lies ahead, but the more you progress, the more confident you become. Routes are randomly generated – albeit packed with similar enough villains and enemies to battle – so each round is different enough to remain engaging.  \\nAt the end of each circuit the game produces a boss for the player to battle. If the player wins, successful, the game continues and the player keeps all the loot, upgrades and skills gained in the round. But if the player loses against the boss, he or she stands to lose an eye-watering 70% of their resources, and is forced back to the home base and must start over with their sadly depleted inventory.  The Nitty Gritty\\nInventory management is fully under your control and must be done carefully to keep winning battles, you cycle round through loop after loop, and each placement of features and resources has a knock-on effect on subsequent loops so you have to plan carefully, laying out enough resources to keep winning, but not so many that you make life impossible for your future self. Finding this balance is the joy of the game! \\nYou choose from several classes – rogue, necromancer, standard warrior – and your choice has an effect on your attack and defence capabilities and weapons. Loot also varies according to class, and you must learn to keep a tight rein on your inventory – it is limited, and new things will push out the old.  \\nThere is a day-night cycle which remains static while the loop gets longer, so you can have more than one day and night in a loop as you progress through the game. Once enough squares are laid down in the loop, the boss enemies begin to appear.   Round and Round You Go!\\nEach successful circuit around the path offers the player the chance to continue on to do another circuit, or return to the base where he or she can put up new buildings, such as a blacksmith or kitchen. Using the gains earned from slaying enemies and defeating bosses, the player can increase their defences, their attack, health regeneration and much more.  \\nWhile en route, around the course you will find that slime spawns periodically, becoming an enemy that the hero must fight. These minor skirmishes earn landscape cards which are tokens for terrain features that can be placed around the course – these include mountains, forests, meadows and buildings amongst others.  \\nPlacing these landscape features confers benefits to the player, and these can be doubled or boosted into special effects by careful placement and combinations – for example, placing nine mountains in a 3 by 3 configuration, boosts your health levels – but also provides you with an entirely new type of enemy to battle! Slaying enemies can also win weapons and resources to use. \\nWhile you are safely at the base, you can edit the deck of landscape cards, which gives you a measure of control over your gameplay. This is important as much of the game takes care of itself without needing direct player input. Battles play out automatically, resources are automatically collected and navigation loops are pre-set – but the game still demands your full attention!   Landscape Details \\nLandscape features, some placed by you, others appearing in response to other actions, all create different side-effects, and some of them work with each other to create an entirely unexpected effect!  Cemeteries spawn skeletons that you must battle Villages are good for some healing benefits and finding lucrative side quests Swamps, as might be expected, are home to nasty mosquitos Dimly lit houses accommodate unexpected vampires Groves of trees hide packs of feral mutated dogs\\nOther features to look out for include spider coves, war-torn battlefields, and haunted derelict houses. Oh, and for every benefit the above offer, there might be negatives too – like the gangs of thieves who hang around in villages and have their eye on your loot!  \\nLoop Hero for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/8402/pcover/8402.jpg?v=1706029402', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 568}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 588\\nname: Fallout 4\\ndescription: Fallout 4 for PC is a highly customisable action RPG with plenty of sandbox style freedoms.  \\nIf you love tightly controlled and disciplined games, this may not be the one for you as you have a choice in just about everything you do, see and travel to, perfect for the mavericks amongst us who always wonder what is behind that rock, inside that disused – or is it? – building and who would much prefer to go off and explore the fantasy world in which they find themselves rather than be funnelled along a story arc, no matter how tightly plotted it is.   About the Game\\nTo understand the premise of the world you will have to simultaneously project yourself forwards and backwards in time. Back to the 1950s to pick up their ideas of what the future would be like, and then forwards to 2287, taking with you much of the shiny chrome and leatherette vibe of 1950s diners, jukeboxes and drive-in theatres, and adding robotic house-keepers, jet-packs, and flying cars amongst many others.  \\nLoosely, the player – as male or female protagonist – witnesses the murder of their spouse and abduction of their child. After some time consuming cryogenics, the protagonist escapes the vault, designated ‘Sole Survivor’ and heads off, determined to track down their son and gain revenge for their partner’s murder.  Pick a Side, Any Side\\nThroughout the game you will come across four different factions and you choose which you want to support.  The Brotherhood of Steel: As the macho sounding name implies, this faction is bursting with war ready heroic soldiers. Join up with them to battle synths, mutants and ghouls: the brotherhood’s aim is to eradicate all these beings from the face of the land. They are also anti-modern tech, gathering and hoarding early tech in order to save the city from corrupting influences. Definitely a faction for those who like to shoot things without worrying about moral sensibilities first! The Railroad: This faction deals with the issues of artificial intelligence and machine learning: at what point does sentience deserve respectful treatment. The Railroad work to save synths from poor treatment, particularly from their sworn enemy the Institute (see below to learn why), and as such, they have to work in secrecy, from a secret location, operating in the shadows and by stealth. This means your quest to join them starts with the hunt for their secret base, and once found, you have to pass a test in order to be admitted to their ranks! The Minutemen: The equivalent of home-bodies, the Minutemen look to maintain the status quo, drive out outsiders and avoid too much drama and conflict. If you do not actively pick a side by choosing one of the other three factions, you might end up a Minuteman by default, almost, just from the way the game plays out. Following a massacre which decimated their numbers, the Minutemen are happy to accept the help of anyone who is willing to lend them a hand. The Institute: This shadowy cabal stretches its malign influence into the early hours of gameplay, but players will not come across it until later. Suffice it to say that if you wonder how people vanish to be replaced by android synths you may be rather interested in this highly technologically advanced establishment – although you may not always appreciate their means of achieving their desired ends – or perhaps you will love, and decide to team up with them!\\nFallout 4 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 603\\nname: Doom\\ndescription: Doom for PC is the fourth game in a series and a return to the origins, being a reboot of the highly acclaimed game that is something of the great-great grandpa of modern gaming – the first edition was released on MS-DOS in 1993, shortly after personal computing became widely normalised. There would have been no double click to access the game: instead, commands would have to be typed into DOS to start play, that’s how long ago that was!  About the Game\\nThe player takes on the persona of an unnamed Marine (called, variously: Doomguy, or Marine, or even Doom Slayer) who is tasked with battling the inhabitants of Hell who have been unleashed upon a freshly colonised Mars by the evil antagonist, employee of Union Aerospace Corporation, one Olivia Pierce who has been promised wonderful things by Satan. \\nFellow corporation employee, Samuel Hayden wants to stop her – but first he has to uncover her secrets, and for that he needs the Doom Slayer who swings into action, despatching demon after demon as he gets on the case. \\nLevels follow fairly predictable patterns: beginning with Samuel giving Doom Slayer his orders, and ending with a massive ‘boss battle’-type scene but this adds a reassuring structure to an otherwise zany game in which anything can (and sometimes does) happen.  Best of the Old/ Best of the New\\nThe game has received enormous praise for recapturing the beloved atmosphere of shooter games from the 90s, while combining it with modern graphics and physics engines to satisfy our ever more critical computing tastes: the painfully slow dial-up connections of the 90s would certainly not appeal to today’s gamers! \\nMany of the weapons, too, have been lifted from the original game for a nostalgic blast, but these too have been upgraded and given new and nasty twists that probably would not have been thought of in the pre-Internet (well, it was there, it just wasn’t all that widely used) days of the 90s. Weapons can be improved and upgraded, so more experienced players have better skills and more powerful weapons: a kind of exponential benefit of playing. \\nIn each level, you will find access to one of the old-school game maps that are hidden until you stumble across them. Once found, they fit themselves into the map menu under the title of ‘classic maps’.  Ways to Play Single player: ‘badass demons, big * guns and moving fast’ is the advice given by the game developers when talking about this mode. Doom Slayer is agile, speedy and facing opponents who are also fast and cunning. He can keep the edge, but only by staying sharp and not letting them overwhelm him or sneak up on him all unawares. There are thirteen maps to play through, but watch out for Ultra Nightmare mode which can lose your save point! Multiplayer: this mode opens up the Doom world to the player with a huge variety of ways to play against other gamers. Deathmatches, freeze tag, King of the Hill and even a Battle Royale style fight to the death are all amongst the offerings in this mode. Winning – even just playing sometimes – awards experience points, these add up to accessing new levels, which unlocks new skins, weapons and other customisation features Level Creation Tool: this mode is called ‘SnapMap’ and it allows players to create, edit and shape levels according to their own preferences and logic. While building the level, the game offers an aerial view, and any missed connections will show up in a different colour, so the connections can be installed. Levels can be test played before they are published \\nDoom for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

That something has gone wrong is immediately clear as you spawn into existence, somehow separated from your compatriots, with no idea of what has happened, and only aware that you must do whatever it takes to survive.   About the Game\\nThe game is an RPG with turn-based play for the combat scenes. No one will survive for long alone, so make sure you gather a good crew about you to help you with your missions – with teamwork you will all survive for longer. You can use in-game companions, or team up with a real world buddy for co-operative play. \\nThe game is set in a dystopian future – something has happened to transform the world into a freezing wasteland with Colorado subject to even more extreme cold and snow than we would consider normal today. This is a shift from the previous games dryer and desert based LA and Arizona, and brings with it a new set of problems for the player’s character and excellent new graphics and imagery that make the game interesting and immersive.   Unique Point of View\\nHaving an isometric viewpoint sounds as though it is something serious and technical, but, in fact, it is pretty simple to grasp, especially when you picture it more visually. It simply means seeing more than you would in real life, due to the perspective being slightly skewed to include more of the scene in the picture, instead of adhering perfectly to real life proportioning. \\nThis point of view is used for video games – and for cartoons and even depictions of theatre performances – because it makes the scene in front of the viewer more compulsive: packed with action and every bit of it clearly visible, as though the world has been compressed ever so slightly to make it more interesting – but not so much that you end up with a fish-eye lens view of everything, which would be very distracting!   Points to Look Out For\\nThe following unique features will enhance your playing experience: see how many of them you can spot or collect:  Overlook: Stephen King’s massive haunted hotel, the Overlook, as seen in The Shining was based on the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park in Colorado, and this same location has been reused in this game, although hopefully the evil and possessive (in many senses of the word) ghosts have been left between the pages of King’s thrilling book. Two Locations: The main two locations in the game are the city of Colorado Springs itself, where all the action will happen, and where you will spend much of your play time, and the Ranger’s base, where you will be given all your missions, get the chance to re-equip and generally ready yourself to get back into the fray. Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: While much of the game is largely the same as the previous incarnation, there is much more of an emphasis on teamwork, with some skills being only team based, and needing team training and practise to master. But once mastered your whole team will be stronger – or your whole enemy squad will be weaker, either of which makes it easier to beat them! \\nWasteland 3 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

The world has become overpopulated and dreadfully polluted which gave rise to a contagion in recent times. As a result, the world has now been decimated by the Malichor plague which is a deadly and incurable disease.  About the Game\\nIn this game, an island has been found that is untouched by the Malichor plague. Teer Fradee as the island is known, is a haven teeming with wildlife, fresh clean landscapes and bursting with plants – all of which might hold the secret to a cure for the plague. \\nThe island is also bursting with magic, and the player must try and establish a settlement on the island, learning the ways of magic and feuding or aiding your fellow settlers, treasure hunters and mercenaries as you work your way through the game. \\nThere are no mod-cons in this seventeenth century world, no electricity, no central heating, no motorised vehicles. What you do have is communities, fantastical creatures, hidden places packed with useful and interesting resources, and locals who know how to use the magic. Perhaps, if you befriend them, they will teach you some of their tricks!  Things to Know About the Game\\nThere are no formal classes or skill-trees to divide you. Every player can learn every skill if they want to, working your way up every skill, or picking and choosing only those skills that you think will benefit your character. \\nThe game is very much open plan, allowing you to go where you will, exploring all areas of the island, talking to the natives and following your own path as you desire. There are hundreds of skills to choose from and thousands of combinations of weapons so you can be sure that your gaming experience will be pretty unique compared to anyone else’s.  \\nThis freedom extends into building your character too. You have hundreds of choices with which to customise your character, starting with gender, and moving on to hair and eye colour, size and shape and very much more besides. \\nThe graphics are beautiful, both photographic in the accuracy of their depictions and artistic in their style, almost like sumptuous paintings against which characters perform their actions, freakish creatures reveal themselves to you, and the background invites you ever onward, to explore more and more: what lies in that cave, over this mountain, or around that corner? Only you can get the answer by grabbing your equipment and setting off!  Three Methods of Successful Questing\\nAs you move over the map – in your own order – you will be given missions and quests which can be solved in three different ways:  Combat: A clean honest fight, battling your way to your destination, besting the opposition and fairly winning your reward for your efforts Diplomacy: Bargaining and chit-chat can get you a long way on this island. Use tact and gentle manipulation to get your way without needing to fight or battle with anyone Deception: Sneakiness comes into play here as you work your way to achieve your goals by lying, sneaking and cheating as best you can. Bear in mind though, getting caught in your deception may cause unwanted reactions from those you are deceiving!\\nJust bear in mind: the island is responsive to your actions, and what you do and even the way in which you do it can cause the island to evolve in unusual and sometimes unexpected ways! \\nGreedFall for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 646\\nname: Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic\\ndescription: Manage all aspects of your republic in this soviet-themed city builder game. A planned economy puts you in control of everything from mining resources to manufacturing goods and providing services – use this power to make decisions that impact your citizens’ day-to-day lives and their ultimate loyalty to the nation. Whether it’s construction, transportation, trade, healthcare, education, entertainment, tourism, or any of the countless other facets of a full-fledged city, it’s up to you to determine availability, accessibility, and quality. Contend with a deep simulation of global supply chains as you seek fertile soils, ore veins, and viable lands upon which to build your nation – let the radio stations sing your praises and the citizens rejoice in their glorious soviet republic.   \\nMultiple complex simulations work together to bring your cities to life in Workers & Resources: Soviet Republic – whether it’s the price of goods in the global market, the proper distribution of electricity and water, or the increased supply of heat during the winter months, everything can be manipulated with the right actions. Adjust your game settings based on your appetite for complexity in particular areas – civil engineers, urban planners, economists, and simulation enthusiasts will all be able to experience the mechanics they love.   Run your nation with both rubles and dollars as you strike a balance between eastern and western markets, trading with nations from either side of the Iron Curtain to gain access to valuable currency, resources, and technology. Despite following a soviet-styled planned economy, you are a fledgling non-aligned nation – this sets you free to engage in trade with both the Western Bloc and the Soviet Bloc to your benefit. Loyalty to one side is always an option, but flooding one market with your goods might result in diminishing returns, and shunning the other side might see you cut off from useful technological advances. Familiarize yourself with the intricacies of realistic supply-chain management with over 30 commodities to acquire, manufacture, and transport. Raw materials, processed goods, and waste material all have specific places where they can be stored, with specific vehicles needed for their transportation, and specific structures needed for loading and unloading. Liquids are stored in tanks and moved with the help of pipes and pumps, or loaded onto vehicles with tanks. Mined ores are stored in aggregate storage facilities, and moved with conveyor belts and flatbed trucks and train cars. Processed goods, meanwhile, are shipped around in covered trucks and train cars, and stored in warehouses. Organize forklifts for short distance hauling, build intricate conveyor belt networks to minimize your reliance on vehicles, or use trains to haul goods from one city to another – supply-chain management is an integral part of operating a nation, and you’ll use everything from cargo planes to freight trains to cargo helicopters to make sure everything is operating smoothly. Every road, bridge, residential building, and factory is built from the ground up with resource costs reflecting the size of the project. Pay market rates for raw materials to execute quick builds with the help of foreign labor, or establish construction offices and provide employment to your population as they head to construction sites to build everything using locally acquired resources. Buildings can require anything from prefab panels, to steel beams, gravel, concrete, and more – produce and supply them locally, or import them to simplify the process. Will you be a self-reliant republic, or will you exploit the international market for rapid expansion?  \\nA nation is nothing without its people – they work the fields, bake the bread, and operate the heavy machinery that keeps the wheels of industry turning. Ensuring the people remain happy and loyal is essential to your success.  Follow your citizens from childhood to the end of their lives, providing them with essential goods such as food and clothes (and alcohol) while simultaneously ensuring they have access to opportunities in the form of education and employment. Be wary of those that lack loyalty to the republic – they are prone to a life of crime, and their reduced efficiency can hurt throughput. Oftentimes, they are best left without access to opportunities where they can do more harm than good. Monitor your nation’s overall happiness and loyalty to ensure few are choosing to leave – provide them with better lives, or rely on propaganda to get the most out of your citizens.Your peoples’ needs can be imported from neighboring countries, or they can be manufactured locally through complex production chains. Massive fields will harvest grains that can be turned into bread and booze at food factories and distilleries. Clothes factories will produce clothes as long as they have fabric, which in turn is produced at fabric factories with the help of crops, chemicals, and water. Manufacture or otherwise acquire all manner of goods, from the aforementioned necessities to the luxuries of radios and TVs, and transport them from factories to warehouses to local stores where your citizens can obtain them to fulfill their needs. There are many essential services your citizens will want access to as well – electricity, water, and heat are necessary for survival, each with their own supply chains to maintain. Watch for demand to ebb and flow with the seasons, and prepare for harsh winters lest your population suffers a sudden tragic drop. Education is provided through schools and universities, with higher levels of education opening up additional employment opportunities for your people, unlocking access to new technologies and production capabilities in your nation. Entertainment comes from local parks and theaters as well as radio and TV stations, while physical fitness is provided by local pools and sports fields. Ensuring these services are available and within reach through an efficient transit system is essential for a healthy, prosperous populace.  \\nFrom roads to railways, and from sea to sky, managing the transportation of goods and people is vital to the health of your republic. As your nation spreads and cities develop around resource hubs littered across massive maps, you’ll find yourself constantly expanding your transportation network to meet ever-growing needs.  Buses, trams, trains, subways, ships, and planes provide public transportation for people to move greater and greater distances, fulfilling needs at distant shops, or providing their expertise at far-flung factories and mines. Operate interconnected systems to facilitate the movement of people across these massive expanses, even using cable cars and winding dirt roads to provide access to the more remote parts of your republic.Trucks, trains, cargo planes, and cargo ships are essential for moving resources long distances, with different subcategories of each vehicle determining exactly what type of goods it can move. Limited access to certain vehicles might force you to explore transit methods you would otherwise have left behind – or perhaps you’ll build connections at customs offices along your border to enable trade with foreign powers instead?Build custom airports, plan the placement of train signals, and design intricate interchanges to truly customize your transit networks. Road signs will influence speed limits and vehicle access, runway length will determine accessibility for various kinds of airplanes, and train stations can be built for passengers or cargo, with access points for pumps, conveyor belts, and forklifts to integrate smoothly into your existing supply chains. Allow your people to purchase cars for private transit, but consider limiting access to such vehicles based on education levels or party loyalty to prevent the plague of freedom of movement and congestion – with well planned infrastructure and transit networks, you can fully control the flow of workers and resources alike. \\nWorkers & Resources: Soviet Republic has dedicated modding tools and a plethora of extensive player-created mods available in the Steam Workshop. Customize your experience with new buildings and vehicles to build the soviet republic of your dreams.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9227/pcover/9227.jpg?v=1702638617', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 646}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 648\\nname: A Plague Tale Innocence\\ndescription: A Plague Tale Innocence for PC is a horror-based, action adventure stealth game in which innocents must struggle for survival against both a political plague and a medical one: evil soldiers and rats being of equal threat to the protagonists.  About the Game\\nThe protagonists are siblings, Amicia and Hugo. Amicia is the main character, and she has been tasked with saving her ill younger brother Hugo who has some sort of blood condition. However, it transpires that this blood condition is part of the reason they are in trouble: the villain seeks to use Hugo’s blood to seize some of the powers it bestows. Powers that neither Hugo nor Amicia know about. \\nAmicia must work to save her brother, despite his taking the part of the villain at one point, being confused about who is and is not on his side. Amicia can craft resources into weapons, storage and much more, when she is in the presence of a work-bench, and she must work hard to stay ahead of the Inquisition-style soldiers.   Hugo: More Than Meets the Eye\\nHugo is an able companion when he is with Amicia, and can be set doing minor tasks while Amicia is otherwise engaged. However, he cannot craft things – Amicia is the only character who can. \\nHugo, who becomes a playable character later in the game, can control rats thanks to the supernatural evil that resides in his blood: the real cause of his illness. He is also small enough to slip into smaller spaces than those that Amicia can fit into. This gives him some advantages and means that playing as him can sometimes be more desirable, even though he is not able to craft resources when necessary. \\nOnce the siblings are reunited, later in the game, all their skills are combined so they can all be used simultaneously to defeat the enemies more expeditiously.  Plagues of Soldiers and Rats\\nThe children initially have to hide from the rampaging soldiers of the Inquisition-style enemy, and wander about, exploring and seeking Hugo’s doctor in the hope that he can help them. As they find work-benches, Amicia can craft materials needed for improving their lives or helping them to survive. \\nLater, swarms of ravenous rats descend on the unwary, consuming and diseasing them. However, the seemingly unstoppable rats do have one weakness – light. This enables the children to survive some quite tricky scenes as they use this weakness to their considerable advantage. \\nThe medieval time setting stymies any modern gadgetry that might otherwise have allowed for ‘cheats’ to make the children’s journey easier.  \\nInstead, things must be done ‘old school’ with ingenuity, crafting the right tools and thinking strategically to use one’s advantages.   Survive the Tale for a Positive Outcome\\nThe game can be described as a series of survival puzzles, with a compelling and exciting storyline filling in the gaps between moments of high tension as the children fight for survival. The arrival of the rats is gruesome, especially when they are attacking characters, and will raise a thrill of horror in even the most hardened horror fan! \\nThere are many trials and tribulations to play through, and each chapter must be completed satisfactorily, before the final loose ends can be wrapped up. But the good news is that there is a happy ending – or the possibility of one at least – with the return of a much-loved character who had been presumed dead, which makes gameplay very satisfying to work through. \\nTouchingly, Hugo picks a flower at the successful conclusion of each chapter, fastening it into Amicia’s hair as a symbol of his acknowledgement of the debt owed to her for keeping him alive and as safe as possible.  Characters to look out for include: Beatrice – the children’s mum Laurentius – Hugo’s doctor Lucas – the doctor’s apprentice Rodric – a blacksmith and helper Melie and Arthur – more siblings \\nA Plague Tale Innocence for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/4236/pcover/4236.jpg?v=1704209160', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 648}),\n",

              " Document(page_content=': 653\\nname: Victoria 3 Grand Edition\\ndescription: Victoria 3 Grand Edition for PC is a grand strategy game – an open-ended historical sandbox, the long awaited and much memed sequel to Victoria II, which was released in 2010. The game covers the period between 1836 and 1936, and allows players to control or explore any of one hundred countries (see below for more).  About the Game\\nThe real life time period introduced massive innovation to the world: steam ships, the telegraph, total industrial revolution as far as production and farming goes. Everyone, in those days, were living in exciting times, whether they knew it or not. \\nThe time period also massively influenced our current lives, so it is interesting to explore the what ifs, as you change certain historical details and see how history might have played out.\\nThere is a strong focus on your population and their demographics with a need to appease population groups known as pops, meaning large sections of people with shared interests. \\nPops have varying ideologies, ideals, and interests that must be considered if they are not going to rebel against your control. \\nThey can also develop unique tastes that must be catered for, no matter how ridiculous you find them: if not, then you get radicals fomenting dissent.   The Nitty Gritty\\nDiplomatic Plays is a new name for an old system: it is a revamped Victoria II’s crisis system. A country can make a list of demands to another, which then counters with their own demands in exchange. This immediately starts a timer. If this runs out with no diplomatic solution arrived upon, war may begin. \\nSome players spend their time attracting allies and deploying troops to strategic placements ready for the timer to run out and waiting for the fight to begin. However, the game developers want you to try and reach a diplomatic solution, believing that war is the failure of diplomacy.\\nTo this end, anything achieved by war can be achieved by diplomacy and will cost fewer of your population their lives. You can use pacts, threats and bluffs to get your own way, which can make diplomacy just as engaging as combat. \\nThere are beautiful graphics throughout the game, even in the menus where you spend a great deal of your time, setting your politics and diplomacy to your preferred levels, alongside a great, stirring soundtrack, and sound effects that are realistic and help you immerse yourself in the game. \\nThe game is very nuanced, with multiple knock-on effects, making it fun to try. The enormous attention to detail means that top tier players will become absorbed in the minutiae of decision-making as they try to work out the effects of each strategy before they enact it.  What Country Can You Rule?\\nThe game’s intensely detailed maps allow players to control any of one hundred countries: as long as they existed during the time period of the game. Amongst others you can play in or around:  Mexico: kicking off in the middle of a period of turbulence for the country: Texas split off to join the United States; and other regions of Mexico wanted independence or autonomy while the rest were trying to form a national government, and there was a scrappy and unsettled time with a number of colonial powers all trying to ‘help’, but things gradually improved and settled down. See what mayhem you can cause by letting the ‘wrong’ side win! Prussia: now part of Germany, this kingdom only existed between 1701 and 1918, and was the driving force behind a united Germany. Despite the kingdom ceasing to exist before the end of the game’s timeline, it is a worthwhile and fascinating moment of history Burma: fully colonised by the British during the timeline of the game (it was a colony from 1824 to 1948), you may know the country better as Myanmar – although some still use Burma because of political considerations. Siam: better known today as Thailand, the kingdom of Siam was a wonderful place: rich in artworks and political intrigue – it is an excellent choice for history buffs Austria: the period of the game begins during a period of calm in Austria, which was rather larger than it is today, thanks in part to its expansion as the Austro-Hungarian empire. However, within about ten years of this calm and largely prosperous beginning, things begin to look a little more revolutionary… The Ottoman Empire: Osman I founded the Ottoman empire from his reign which began in around 1298. It lasted an incredible 626 years until 1924 when it was finally ended by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. During the timeline of the game, the Ottoman Empire had dealings throughout Europe, from warring with Russia to trade deals with Great Britain to allowing Greece its independence USA: fresh from the birth pangs of the American nation, the game’s timeline kicks off while abolitionists were beginning to gain traction for their anti-slavery campaigns, joined by women’s suffrage and temperance movements – in short, the USA was deciding who it wanted to be when it grew up, making this a great period to play in, seeing how different decisions could impact on US life today China: during this period China was living through interesting times: the two Opium Wars raged, the British were hellbent on getting their hands on Chinese tea, using money, deceit and drugs to achieve their aims Russia: Russia is a scrappy nation and the timeline of the game just proves this. The country fights with the Ottoman Empire, it fights with Britain and France in the Crimean War, it fights with Poland, and finally, begins to fight within its own borders.

About the Game\\nSet in the year 2508, a dystopian space age future in which the Earth’s resources have been plundered, forcing widespread exploration through the galaxy. Planetcrackers, mining ships that plunder barren planets for their resources, are everywhere and the oldest of these, Ishimura, is illegally mining the planet Aegis VII, which is otherwise lightly populated with colonists. \\nMeanwhile, some time ago, back on Earth, an alien artefact called the Marker was found and has formed the basis of a new religion, Unitology, under the leadership of Michael Altman – one of the original researchers on the Marker. Later, Aegis VII is found to have a replica of the Marker, this one called the Red Marker, created by Earth Government (who were responsible for the creation and concealment of several Red Markers on various planets. \\nUnitologists and Earth Government officials form two warring factions in the game. However, experiments in weaponizing the Marker – and its copies – has resulted in what is essentially a zombie army – an infection that turns corpses into undead beings known as Necromorphs – and they begin to emerge just as the colonists and Ishimura crew begin to suffer mental health issues and hallucinations. \\nArriving on schedule a while later, the maintenance ship, Kellion arrives to find that most people – all colonists and many Ishimura crew have been turned into Necromorphs. The protagonist is Isaac Clarke whose girlfriend, Nicole Brennan, was the medical officer on the Ishimura and he is frantic to find out what has happened to her.   The Nitty Gritty\\nThe makers have not changed the major features of the game: the characters, the basic plot and so on, but they have adjusted parts of the game (such as Isaac’s voice being provided by the same actor who voiced Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 – the 2008 original didn’t have him talk at all) to make its integration with the series more seamless.\\nThe developers have also cut out parts of the game and gameplay that didn’t work as they should – these were not chosen by the developers, rather, they consulted with game fans to ensure they got it right. \\nAccessibility and graphics/ sounds effects have been improved to modern industry standards, but aside from these fans of the original will easily recognise it as the game they know and love. There are, however, some new features:\\nThe games AI ramps up the intensity with the new Intensity Director which ensures that, for example, a room that was lit on your first playthrough might be in darkness should you need to return to that same place. New enemies spawn in random places – so you can’t ambush them, and Necromorphs can and do wander into rooms you’ve already cleared, so don’t let yourself get too complacent if it all seems to be going well. \\nAlso new to the reboot, the entire ship of the Ishimura is walkable in one continuous shot, with no time delay pauses while each section loads. The anti-gravity boots that kept Isaac jumping from surface to surface in the original are gone and he can float about in pursuit of Necromorphs  Important Characters\\nAlongside Isaac there is: Nicole herself, who appears to Isaac at random moments Chief security officer Zach Hammond Computer tech Kendra Daniels – who is also, we find out early on, an Earth Government spy sent to try and take control of the situation Challus Mercer, an insane scientist, a survivor from the Ishimura who believes that Necromorphs are a higher form of being, an ascended human – he worships them Dr Terrence Kyne, a survivor from the Ishimura who wants to return the Marker to Aegis VII\\nDead Space for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 717\\nname: Total War: Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai\\ndescription: A Total War Saga: FALL OF THE SAMURAI features a dramatic clash of traditional Samurai culture with the explosive power of modern weaponry.Now including all DLC faction packs, build up your armies with the Saga, Obama, Tsu and Sendai factions.   \\nAbout Total War Saga: FALL OF THE SAMURAI \\nSet 400 years after the events of Total War: SHOGUN 2, guide ancient Japan into the modern age, as the arrival of America, Britain and France incites a ferocious civil war which will decide the future of a nation.\\nBased on the backdrop of the Boshin War period, the new campaign starts in 1864, a time of growing resentment against Western colonial power and influence. As Japan begins to modernise and industrialise, the inevitable social and economic changes lead to increasingly militant nationalism and antipathy towards the Shogunate. \\nPlay as a clan supporting the Imperial throne (Choshu, Satsuma, Tosa), or the last Shogunate (Aizu, Nagaoka, Jozai) in a sandbox campaign map reflecting the time period of 19th century Japan. \\nThe American, British and French nations play an important part in the story of the Boshin war, and your relations with these foreign powers will be integral to unit recruitment and to advancing your technology trees.  About the Saga Faction Pack  The Modernisers \\nCenturies of trade with outsiders has given the people of Saga an understanding of foreign and modern ways, allowing them to adopt new military technology quickly. \\nThe Saga domain is ruled by Nabeshima Mochizuru, the latest in a line of daimyo who were given this territory after the Tokugawa won the vicious civil war of the Sengoku Jidai. The Saga did well by being sensible enough to join the Tokugawa cause while there was still some doubt over the result. They did not wait until the Battle of Sekigahara to decide where their true loyalties lay. \\nThe domain includes the port of Nagasaki, a valuable resource for any daimyo. It is here that Japan has its only official trade with the West, and it is here that interesting ideas arrive in the country. Perhaps this knowledge of the harshness of the outside world is what has convinced the Saga to throw their weight behind the Imperial Court rather than the Shogun. \\nThe Saga clan can rely on a few advantages in the coming struggle: they have Western connections and trade that is far ahead of any other domain. In turn, this learning allows them to be artillery experts, and have good shipbuilding and industrial facilities. The modern world has much to offer to those who would embrace it. Interestingly, the historical Nabeshima Mochizuru eventually resigned his position and left Japan to study in England.About the Obama Faction Pack  The Overseers \\nWith long experience of government and administration, the authoritarian people of Obama are unsurpassed in controlling people and trade. \\nThe Sakai clan, the rulers of Obama, are firm supporters of the Shogunate. The original Sakai lord of the domain, Sakai Tadakatsu, was one of the roju, or elders, under Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first Shogun. This was a hugely important post in the affairs of Japan, and Tadakatsu was correspondingly powerful within the Shogunate\\'s administration. The Sakai clan could also claim to be related to the Minamoto clan, and to be cousins of both the Tokugawa and the Matsudaira clans. They are, then, very well connected. Their domain is worthy of them. The town of Obama had been a prosperous trading port, but its importance declined as Japan closed itself off from the outside world. It remained an important link to Ezo, modern Hokkaido. \\nBecause of their long experience of government and administration, they are experts at managing the population of their lands. They receive a taxation bonus and are highly efficient at repression. They also spend money wisely, and they pay less upkeep for land units. All their garrison troops are also of high quality.About the Tsu Faction Pack  The Betrayers \\nRising from humble roots, the people of Tsu are wise, artful and astute strategists. Their use of Ninja is unsurpassed on the battlefield and in covert operations. \\nThe Todo clan, rulers of the Tsu domain, cannot claim a proud samurai lineage like many of the other great clans of Japan. Their beginnings are actually rather humble: Todo Takatora was an ashigaru, a peasant footsoldier, during the great wars of the Sengoku Jidai. So what? So too was the mighty general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, revered as one of the three great unifiers of Japan! Todo Takatora was wise enough to side with the Tokugawa clan at Sekigahara, and he was rewarded with the fief of Tsu, comprising a good part of the provinces of Iga and Ise. \\nHistorically, the Tsu chose to play a \"long game\", apparently supporting the Shogunate until the very last moment. At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi they sided with the Choshu and Satsuma domains, and therefore with the Imperial forces. They then provided the Imperialists with a strategic position to continue the drive towards Kyoto. Their central position on the mainland, in what is now Mie Prefecture, lay between Edo and Kyoto, and this allowed them enviable flexibility and options in their loyalties. Such flexibility goes some way to explain why they have such excellent shinobi at their command.About the Sendai Faction Pack  The Negotiators \\nFiercely loyal to the incumbent Tokugawa Shogunate, the noble people of Sendai endured the ages of turmoil to emerge as respected tacticians and sublime diplomats. \\nDate Yoshikuni, the lord of Sendai, is loyal to the Shogunate. His family have been loyal to the Tokugawa clan since the end of the wars of the Sengoku Jidai. Then, Date Masamune had proven himself worthy, and established the domain with the blessing of the first Shogun. Even before then, the Sendai had been a noble and notable family of samurai, beginning as the Isa clan under the Minamoto. Given control of the Date province, and taking the name as their own, they survived centuries of turmoil. They have done this by political guile, implacable enemies, and fierce warriors. Now, as lords of Sendai, they are still all of those, even after centuries of relative peace. In battle, Sendai armies have longer when attacking, and need to defend for less time, making victory less of a race to achieve. The Sendai also have a bonus to all diplomatic efforts and are tolerant towards people with different allegiance.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/829/pcover/829.jpg?v=1664444686', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 717}),\n",

It is a successful mixture of Wild West type survival and sci fi space exploration, offering the most fun bits of both worlds in an engrossing game that will keep you playing happily for hours.  About the Game\\nYou begin the game by customising your character, as so often is the case. You will pick one of four classes for your character (see below for details) and then arm yourself against the variety of human and monster enemies that you will be battling. You can play solo, or with two other players depending on your preferences and the availability of your mates. \\nWeapons are rifles and shotguns, but they can be upgraded and improved with modifications, and you can opt for every assisting trick, gizmo and gadget on the market, or you can play old-school with just a simple cross-hair through which to aim at your opponents.  \\nAs you play, explore the map to your heart’s content – the game is not open world with missions keeping you tied to one area until it is complete, but within that area the map is spacious enough that you feel as though you are moving at your own motivation rather than being funnelled along a narrow path. So, take your time and speak to any non-playing characters (NPCs) that you come across and accept side missions and mini quests from them as you go. \\nInstead of level difficulty this game offers world tiers, with higher tiers offering more challenging quests which offer more rewards in the form of loot. Despite the presence of enemies, the focus of the game is rather more player versus environment over player versus player, which is better for those who like to test their skills against the game without having to watch out for fellow players coming along to sabotage their best efforts!\\nThe core game will run to 25 – 30 hours with plenty of extras in the form of side quests and missions from NPCs.   What’s the Story?\\nThe basic premise of the game is simple: having completely drained the Earth of all its usable resources, humanity has fortuitously discovered planet Enoch, which is (very nearly) perfect to support human life. This attempt to colonise the planet is still in its early stages, and you and your band of compatriots are tracking a mysterious signal to discover what it is and who is sending it. All of a sudden, the expedition is disrupted by a mysterious energy storm which they call ‘The Anomaly’. The Anomaly turns out to be basically a storm which will eat you, given half the chance, and if it doesn’t do that, it will mutate you! The mutations are not all bad, however, and Enoch’s indigenous inhabitants and colonists end up with a variety of superpowers.   How Classy Are You?\\nThe four classes you can choose from when setting up your character are as follows:  Trickster – annoy enemies and impress friends by manipulating time to suit your own purposes Pyromancer – burn enemies and light cooking fires for friends by manipulating fire to suit your own purposes Devastator – unleash seismic waves and blasts upon hordes of enemies to clear the path in one fell swoop Technomancer – use your mutant powers to awaken defunct technologies and make them do your bidding\\nOutriders for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own. \\nBanished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad. \\nThere are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand. \\nThe success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/1510/pcover/1510.jpg?v=1649168219', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 731}),\n",

Lead your people: a small group of refugees who were forced to start again on an unknown island. \\nTerraform and shape the land and expand with houses, pastures, orchards, farms, windmills and many other buildings. Forage in the forest, hunt for prey, grow crops and domestic animals for food. As Winter creeps up, ensure you stock up with enough firewood, charcoal and warm clothes to survive, and remember: a lack of vitamins in good rations may lead to disease and could even totally wipe out your village! \\nYou can oversee your village from a birdseye view or occupy one of your villagers to control and perform tasks in a first person view to speed things up or just to explore.  Some of the more exciting features:  Advanced farming system. Different crops and fruit trees require varying amounts of moisture, man labour and time in order to ripen ready for harvest. Your pastures and hens require hunters to protect them from forest predators.  Switch between birdseye and first person views. You can play in a birdseye view, watching over everything and issuing strategic orders, or you can possess a villager and play from a first person perspective, performing everyday tasks along with your fellow villagers.  Terraforming and pavement. Terraform land around your settlement to enable construction of larger buildings. Pave roads to speed up the movement of your villagers and thus improve the economy of your settlement.  Diseases, food rations and vitamins. Diseases spread faster in cold weather, especially if your villagers lack warm clothes or their food ration is too plain and lacking in vitamins. Try to stock all types of food possible (meat, fish, bread, vegetables and fruits) to keep your villagers’ healthy.  Dynamic ecosystem. Villagers continuously walking in the surrounding woods will scare wildlife deeper into forest. Excessive farming or woodcutting can lead to flora and fauna extinction thus lowering the flow of meat, hides, mushrooms, berries and medical herbs to your stocks.  Real time weather and seasons system. The seasons effect your village’s needs: summer droughts will force your farmers to water your crops and rainy days will force them to dig trenches to drain excess water, and you’ll need firewood and warm clothes for your villagers in Winter.  Morale and increasing population. Keep your villagers happy and their families will grow - that is, if their needs are being met! Living in overcrowded hostels, unfulfilled requirements and even bearing witness to a villager’s demise will reduce morale and their productivity.  Disasters. Lightning can hit tall buildings that are standing on hilltops. Tornados can leave a devastating trail of destruction across your settlement. Earthquakes can destroy your houses and even topple trees. Make sure you are prepared to face those challenges! Mod friendly. Our game is designed to be modder friendly. Game modders will have access to AI, animations, task and resource management, navigation, sounds and many other game systems.

Moonbury has around 30 unique inhabitants who will occasionally fall ill and call for your aid. Sick residents will have their schedules interrupted while they recuperate in bed.

Thousands of ships and stations trade, mine and produce, all realistically simulated. In this universe, you can grow from being the lone pilot of a fighter ship, to managing a vast empire, commanding your fleets and designing colossal space stations. Transition seamlessly from first-person action, boarding ships and visiting their bridges, to an expansive strategy and management simulation. Choose your own path at your own pace. The decisions are yours. Trade - Fight - Build - Think.  Start your journeyIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.Fly every shipX4 allows you to fly all ships personally. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.  Build space stations and upgrade your shipsBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.Experience the most dynamic X universe everX4 is the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.  Manage your empire with a powerful mapOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands. Graphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.Dive into the most detailed X economy everOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.Research and teleportThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand. Every order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself.

Fun fact for you: the game actually has a new species of scorpion named for it!

What’s the Story?\\nYou take on the character of an engineer who has crash landed on a planet, and your ultimate goal is to build a spacecraft that will enable you to either leave the planet or summon help – but you can take your time completing this task and fully explore the world before you take your man home. You can play single-player, co-op mode or multiplayer, depending on your needs. \\nUnlike most resource gathering, crafting games, this game needs to make huge quantities of items, so instead of doing the hard work yourself, your job is to layout rows upon rows of factories, each crafting the parts you need to make other goods – you can even make factories to make the component parts of more factories! You could say that instead of crafting, you set up crafting processes. \\nIf this sounds confusing, do not worry, there is a good detailed tutorial that will talk you through everything you need to know to get started on the way to serious factory farming without stress or frustration.  Not all Industrial Though\\nThe planet was not entirely free of inhabitants, and there are three type of animal/ creature living on the planet. They are called Biters, Spitters, Worms, and are usually peaceful – except when pollution from your factories poisons their food and water! They will attack, becoming more vicious, the worse your pollution is!  \\nYou can deal with them in two ways – manage your pollution by producing less, or you can build defences to keep the beasts out, or even kill them off – even these defences can benefit from your automation processes and you can enjoy automatic combat!   How to Build a Factory\\nThere are three main components for building a factory and which need to be placed appropriately and in the right numbers to achieve your desired purpose:  Conveyor belts – carry the raw materials from where you are mining them, bringing them to the factory ready for the next stage Assemblers – these make the fiddly bits of your factory and churn out all the parts you need Inserters – these clever automated processes fit the parts made by the assemblers together to create the product you need\\nYou can create factory processes for anything – even for making the parts needed to build more factories, until you get into a position where expansion is inevitable and almost effortless!  \\nFactorio for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

The game has a unique following amongst those who love the series, and this version offers some exciting new options.  About the Game\\nPlayers work at tasks that simulate real life farming tasks, from breeding the best livestock, to growing crops for cash, general good farm management is a must to help the player sell assets that are created on the farm. \\nPrevious versions of the game have included animals like sheep, pigs, cows and chickens: this version has added horses, due, it is said, to popular demand. Crops include brand new cotton and oats alongside wheat and corn (or grains), soybeans, root crops like potatoes, as well as poplar, sugar cane, silage, hay and grass. All the crops and animals have different needs, and must be managed in slightly different ways to the others, giving you plenty of interest in raising a variety of crops and animals.  \\nA big plus for this version of the game is the introduction of, alongside the horses, cotton and oats, as mentioned above, high-end branded machinery, including the well-known John Deere, alongside the likes of Komatsu and Rau, not to mention Wilson trailers.  Play for Zen in Three Exciting Worlds\\nThe beauty of the game is that much of the work is endlessly repetitive: lots of ploughing, sowing, watering, and reaping. This means that the game is basically a grind game, but this is its attraction to the many players who adore it: the repetitive actions have a charm all their own, being almost therapeutic.  \\nThere is, however, enough variety with seasonal changes and with taking on new farming tasks, like raising animals or changing the crops being grown to keep the game fresh and interesting. You are even impelled, occasionally, to change your vehicle from time to time as well as performed basic maintenance tasks like refuelling: all of which ensures that your interest remains high and the game does not become boring. \\nThere are three distinct open worlds to play in, each having significant differences to the others. Try them all before picking your favourite to grow your ideal farm, complete with crops and animals.  How to Get Started Start from scratch\\nBuild your farm up from nothing, clearing the ground, sowing the seed and slowly expanding the terrain as you build the assets that allow you to do so.  Begin in the middle! \\nCheat the system slightly by starting with an already established, moderately sized farm that has initial crops in place and a system just waiting for you to pick up the reins.  Manage for the big guy\\nGet right ahead of the game and start off managing a bigger farm rather than owning your own smaller one. This option gives you access to assets that you might otherwise not be able to get your hands on for a while.  Multiplayer\\nInvite your farming enthusiast friends to come along and farm alongside you. Six people working together makes farm chores a breeze, and you can even invite people from up to fifteen other farms to join up for a huge farming extravaganza.  Career Mode\\nWill take you along the path of a long term farmer, moving gracefully through the seasons, slowly building your farm to the peak of profitability as you go. Meanwhile, Mission Mode offer shorter term satisfaction. Complete tasks, such as mowing or delivering cargo for cash. These tasks have time limits and will earn a bonus for early completion: see how many bonuses you can earn. \\nFarming Simulator 19 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

              " Document(page_content=': 830\\nname: Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2\\ndescription: Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 for PC is a tactical shooter game with a strong element of puzzle-kill to it (these are shooter games with an element of puzzle-solving to work out the correct target or gain access to them). It is the second of the ‘Contracts’ games but the sixth overall in the Sniper Ghost Warrior series.   About the Game\\nThe game – a mission-based, stealthy and immersive simulation game with massive maps and high replayability – offers the player plenty of creative chances for observation and curiosity. One of the absolute best bits of the game is the ridiculously long shots – seriously ridiculous! – that you can pull off in this game (see below for details). The ‘bullet cam’ is cheesily dramatic, but great fun, and helps to pull off this satisfyingly sharp precision shooting! \\nYou play as Raven, an assassin with a lengthy kill-list, and begin the game when you are dropped into an exotic location with your list of targets to work your way through while you are there – the contracts of the game’s title. The game is set in ‘modern day’ rather than the previous alternate history of the other games in the franchise. \\nAs always with these games, you cannot just go barrelling in and taking out everyone in sight… Well, you can, but it tends to have consequences! Be observant and take note of enemy soldiers, use exploding barrels and fuse boxes to set up each mission, and generally just see how creative you can be. Speak to as many locals as you can without triggering any suspicions, and see what, if any, intelligence they can offer that might help you get along.  \\nYou can replay your favourite contracts to earn upgrades, power-ups and cool gadgets to help you be an even better sniper. And you can perform each mission a different way each time, learning just how you can use the environment to suit your nefarious purposes.  The Nitty Gritty\\nThe long range missions topped out at about 400m for the first Contracts game, but in this one we get the abovementioned ridiculously long-distance precision shots – 1,000m to 1,400m! At that distance people will not even hear the shot that kills the guy standing right next to them! Nor will they hear your shriek of delight seeing them fall!  \\nJust to reiterate: that’s nearly a mile to make the shot – and you more or less have to make it from one vantage point. The game is set up to encourage you to try and mix it up a bit, with some targets only accessible at a distance, while others can be messier and more creative, up close and very personal! \\nYou can also stealth creep through some bad-guy camps dropping villains or henchmen with a silenced hand-gun, but the sniper element of the game (as implied by the title) is by far the most fun element. The maps are divided into disparate areas with primary and secondary mission maps clearly demarcated, so you always know where you are and where you should be. \\nSpeaking about creativity, you can use your bullets to drop things (a dangling container, or an immense statue, for example) on your targets, and you also gain points for style and creativity, but getting the job done, whether with dramatic flair or with a classic bullet to the brain, is what counts in the long run.  \\nOne bit of work that is needed is your weaponry. You will need to master the use of the scope to work out how far away your target is, and this can be quite tricky, but it is worthwhile to make those oh-so-satisfying ridiculously long shots. The wind indicators too need some getting used to, but they can help you pinpoint your targets.  Mission Assist Features\\nYour guns are highly specialist and your pack comes with various assist-features that you can toggle on or off to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game. These include:  An automated sniper turret helps you mark and nab your targets Use binoculars to scope the land, especially to find high points to take your shots from Your drone can fly over tricky areas spotting enemies hiding from your direct gaze Finally, not as high-tech as the rest, use your crouch-walk facility to stealth-creep through enemy camps\\nSniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2 for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/6718/pcover/6718.jpg?v=1707323979', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 830}),\n",

We’ve gathered three of our most beloved games into one handy pack! With so many titles to choose from, we decided to help take out some of the guesswork and hand you three games that are sure to give you hours of entertainment! \\nWe’ve updated Quiplash 3, Trivia Murder Party 2 and Tee K.O. with all of our most recent settings and improvements such as moderation, subtitles, content filtration, and settings menu upgrades. Additionally, we’ve fully localized the voice acting, subtitles and even credit songs in French, Italian, German and Spanish!  \\nNo extra controllers needed; players use their phones or tablets to play along! Got a bigger group? Play with up to 8 players and up to 10,000 audience members.  Quiplash 3   \\nPlayers enter a head-to-head battle of wits by answering a comedic prompt and letting the other players (and the audience) decide which they like best! \\nIs that it? Uh, no. \\nQuiplash 3 now has a Moderation feature that allows responses to be seen prior to being displayed on screen. Additionally, a new filtering option allows profanity and hateful speech to be blocked before even reaching moderation. \\nSo that’s it, right? \\nThank you for asking, but no! Quiplash 3 has a new final round called Thriplash, where the prompts ask players to enter three responses. That’s three times the chances to be funny! \\nOriginally part of The Jackbox Party Pack 7, Quiplash 3 in The Party Starter has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German and Spanish!  Tee K.O.   \\nIn Tee K.O., players are on the clock to create drawings and write as many slogans as possible. The pictures and slogans are then given out at random. Whoever combines their drawings and slogans to create the best t-shirt wins, as designs are pitted against each other in head-to-head battles. The t-shirts with the highest votes in each round must survive the final gauntlet to become the best. Tee… K.O. Get it? \\nPerhaps the most beloved part of Tee K.O. is the fact that you can make your stupid great creations a reality and purchase actual versions of your t-shirts. Just click the gallery button at the end of the game or view your past galleries at Jackbox.tv. \\nOriginally in The Jackbox Party Pack 3, Tee K.O. has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German and Spanish! \\nWe made it easy to share your t-shirts on Facebook and Twitter. Be sure to tag @jackboxgames to show us what you’ve made! For some reason, it’s a lot of shirts with hotdogs….  Trivia Murder Party 2   \\nStill on the run from the police after the events of the first Trivia Murder Party, the serial killer host has moved into the Murder Hotel where he grew up. In the past his family killed unsuspecting guests at their hotel, but now the host is using the hotel to run his bizarre game show… where he kills unsuspecting guests. \\nLike the first Trivia Murder Party, players answer trivia questions–and answering incorrectly will send you to the Killing Floor to play mini-games that can kill. New mini-games include avoiding swords jabbed into a magician’s box, tattooing the killer’s back, and most terrifying of all… using a rotary phone! \\nTrivia Murder Party 2 is packed full of new surprises. Can you finish the game with a bomb strapped to your body? What would you do if you could haunt one of the other players? Would it be weird if the killer thought you were his mother? \\nOriginally in The Jackbox Party Pack 6, Trivia Murder Party 2 has been fully revamped with new features and localizations in French, Italian, German and Spanish!  How to Play Remotely\\nhttps://www.jackboxgames.com/remoteplay/\\nPlayers use any web-enabled device (like a smartphone or tablet) to join the game and play along. When playing with remote players, you can use a video conferencing tool like Zoom, Steam Broadcast, Google Hangouts, Discord, and more to connect with others!

              " Document(page_content=\": 895\\nname: Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\\ndescription: Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy for PC is a single player, narrative driven, episodic game with a fairly linear premise. It is strongly mission based, and the story is loosely based on the comic book series of the same name. There are movies in the franchise which use the same characters as are featured in the game and the original comics.  About the Game\\nThe basic premise of this game is that the team of characters must find the Eternity Forge, an artefact of great power. The antagonist is Kree Hala the Accuser, who wants it herself. The player plays primarily as Star-Lord, but will occasionally play as the others in the many flashbacks that flesh out the team dynamic and provides characters’ backstories. The humour that made the movies so popular is here too, and carries across well. \\nJust as in the movie and the comics, music is important. All the backing tracks to the game are all belters from the 70s and 80s. This is a major connection between Peter (Star-Lord and his past, his childhood and the now mostly defunct Earth. On occasion, you get to choose the background track to inspire the team to a greater effort against the villains. \\nThe five episodes that comprise the game (see more about this below) play out with plenty of cliff-hanger ups and downs, with a story arc to follow and important player choices to be made. Players can make good choices or bad one, depending on your preferences, and these actions will have sometimes unexpected future consequences.  \\nThe characters on the Milano are all likeable and distinctive: there is Star-Lord, who is cocky, brash, optimistic; Gamora, a world weary cynical warrior; Drax who typifies ‘all brawn and no brain’; Rocket is a sardonic modified raccoon with a dark backstory and Groot is a humanoid tree.  \\nNebula and Mantis are not Guardians, per se, but they show up along the way too to help out and hinder as the story demands.   The Nitty Gritty\\nThe game is strongly team based, with all the characters needed for true success in any scenario. Your AI-controlled fellow Guardians are more than up to the task and ‘remember’ your previous choices and instructions extrapolating them forward, so it really feels as though they are working with you, rather than waiting to be told what to do. \\nAlong with this, the characters still have their own unique personalities – for example, Drax takes on too many enemies at once, while Gamora is more cautious. Star-Lord loves to shoot, and this can be teamed with jumping, dodging, trying out new moves that you’ve just unlocked, and executing melee strikes. It is up to you to set the team members tasks that they will cope with well. \\nThe enemies’ health bars can be seen at all times, letting you know if you need all your strength, or just one or two more shots to finish them off which can be useful when you are unsure of whether to press on or fall back to recuperate and regroup.  \\nFill your XP bar to unlock unique abilities. You can inspire your team to success by choosing the right inspirational speech or background track. This does more than just make them feel good, it actually gives them boosts and abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. You can also do things like letting Drax throw Rocket over a ravine to make a bridge quickly – but Rocket might not be so willing to help next time!   Five Episodes to Play Through\\nThere are five ‘episodes’ in the game’s story arc, each developing the story along and all are song titles, for those who recognise their late 70s/ early 80s music.   Tangled Up in Blue Under Pressure More Than a Feeling Who Needs You Don’t Stop Believing\\nMarvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9016/pcover/9016.jpg?v=1659947591\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 895}),\n",

You take control and tell them to gather materials and build walls, floors and furniture. \\nYou are not limited to predefined buildings! Design your own houses and style them to your liking. There are dozens of construction and furniture elements that you can use to create the settlement you’ve always dreamed of!  Take Care Of Your Villagers\\nThe villagers are your top priority. At first, you simply need to provide them with food and shelter. But the world is full of dangers! An infection might prove fatal to the strongest warrior and a plague can wipe out your entire settlement. \\nEach villager reacts to events, happy or sad, and reflects that in their behavior. Happy villagers will receive a boost to their productivity – Unhappy villagers might throw a temper tantrum.  Raise your Family\\nVillagers go through a lot together, so they value their friendships very high. Some might even decide to start a family – and you’ll soon be welcoming new members to the group! \\nThe little ones are the future of the village, so make sure they have a happy childhood and an adequate education – sometimes achieving both can be difficult.  Set up your FarmFood matters. Good food makes colonists happy, wrong food makes colonists sick, little food makes colonists slow, and no food makes colonists die. \\nGrow a variety of seasonal crops and set up a kitchen to make delicious meals. Be sure to stock up before winter hits and act quick when a swarm of hungry bugs descends upon your fields!  Survive WinterUse the time you have and make sure you have enough food stored away, for winter is coming. Let’s hope you won’t have to halve rations – because that will make your colonists weak. \\nWhen supplies dwindle and the freezing cold wind howls outside, it’s easy to lose hope.  Trade Goods and Get RichWord got around that your colony has started producing wares. Greet traveling traders and see if you can get a good deal on some ancient scrolls or buy additional food to prepare for winter. \\nTry to keep production up so you’ll always have something to sell. A mature colony needs to pay good salaries to keep everyone happy. If morale is low, additional funds can even buy a tiny bit of happiness!  Research TechnologiesBuilding your home is a long process and resources and manpower are not the only things you need. Smart Settlers dedicate a lot of time to researching new technologies, thereby unlocking better equipment, new furniture and construction elements. \\nSelect scholars carefully – if their personality doesn’t fit this type of work, they are not going to make a lot of progress.  Protect Your OutpostYou are not alone in this new land you call ‘home’. Some Tikigoblins living there are not all that happy about your settling efforts and might pay you a visit to try to get you to stop. \\nTrain your colonists in the art of warfare and equip them with the best weapons and armor you have. Build walls and towers to ensure the security of your colony – that way, your enemies will have a difficult time trying to mess with you!

The military sci-fi first person shooter game has a vast following as humanity fights for survival against aliens and religious zealots – and alien religious zealots too.  About the Game\\nMaster Chief returns! Following on from the events of Halo 5, this game picks up the Master Chief’s story, and takes him back in time with a new set of armour that is a nostalgic nod to earlier games and appearance by the Master Chief \\nHalo 4 started a trilogy, that is known as the Reclaimer Trilogy, and that this is the final episode of that trilogy. The events of Halo Wars 2 are also relevant, weaving into the story and providing some points of interest and plot detail that help to make the game a solid, immersive experience. \\nThe Master Chief’s equipment can now be customised in a very detailed manner, especially when compared to Halo 5, which offered a fairly basic, standardised helmet and bodysuit. This game is so detailed that you can choose individual pieces of kit, right down to the shoulder protectors that fit into the armour!  What is a Halo?\\nWithin the game, the Halo Array refers to an immense series of ring-shaped super-weapon in which a small planet’s population could comfortably live. They were designed in antiquity by the Forerunners to vanish the Flood (a parasitic sentient life force that infects any living being), but which have now been claimed as religious artefacts which could carry the above-mentioned zealots on the long awaited ‘Long Journey’.  \\nThere is a halo ring featured in this game, and Master Chief will have to keep his wits and weapons sharp (so to speak) as he battles to best the opposition \\nA quick point: microtransactions are part of this game, but the developers have avoided the whole lootbox vs gambling vs irate bill payer’s argument by leaving lootboxes out of the game entirely. You can pay to advance more readily, but you will always get what you are paying for.  Ways to Play Single player – play along the story arc, taking out enemies, learning more about friends and Master Chief himself as you work your way to the story’s conclusion Multiplayer – play with friends or against strangers with up to three other players. The game will display on your screen as a 4-way split screen so you can keep an eye on what the other guys are up to as well as watching your own back Forge mode is back! The sort-of equivalent of a ‘creation’ world, Forge allows you to customise maps and tweak your game playing experience. Designed to allow players to create new areas, the developers have been so impressed by Forge creations that they have included even more content, with plenty of resources, tools and so on Battle Royale Mode? – There is NO Battle Royale mode in this game, but the developers have mused aloud the fact that, players, should they be keen enough and determined enough, could create a Battle Royale style arena in Forge Mode, setting the appropriate rules of play…\\nHalo Infinite for PC and Xbox ONE is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart.

              " Document(page_content=': 935\\nname: Skul: The Hero Slayer\\ndescription: Skul: The Hero Slayer for PC is a fun but challenging roguelike/ rogue lite game with typical roguelike side-scrolling platformer action and multiple rooms to win your way through. Over and over, sometimes, but that is all part of the fun.  About the Game\\nThe player (you!) takes on the persona of Skul, a demon powering or possessing a skeleton. Inverting the usual hero versus demon trope, in this game you are the good guy, trying to rescue the Demon King who has been attacked and taken prisoner (along with all the other demons save Skul) for no other reason than the heroes wanting to prove that they are heroes and can do hero stuff.  \\nThe Demon’s King unwonted removal has seen the kingdom left in disarray, and the lack of anyone left to keep things running smoothly threatens to create major upheaval. Skul arms himself as best he can, and goes off to try and take on those ‘heroes’ of the Carleon Kingdom who mistake noise and bullying for bravery and chivalry… \\nSkul, on the other hand, is small and untrained, having to learn as he goes along, and shows what true heroism is, by trying to rescue the Demon King, not to prove anything or gain any reward, but simply because he was the only one left to make the attempt.  Tips to – ha! – Get Ahead!\\nThe game is hard, especially at first, but if you pay attention to how the enemies act and fight, you will soon learn the best way to dispatch them or avoid their attacks which tend to be fairly formulaic. \\nSkul’s best weapon is his head, literally in one case as he can take it off, throw it at an enemy and then teleport to the head to pull himself back together. But that’s not the only head game in town: you can use different skulls to harness unique and diverse modes of combat and the wide range of weapons they offer (see below for some examples). \\nNew skulls are found every four or five rooms along – after the first room which is designed to give you enough to get through the next few eventually, after some frustration! The high-powered skills are more rare than the common ones, as you might expect.  \\nSkulls with powers you don’t want or already have can be broken into bone fragments that are then used to power up those that you do keep. There are up to forty unique skulls altogether, and you can use two at a time, swapping as you need to in order to get the best out of the powers on offer. \\nCollect relics as you go, and be sure to keep your eyes open for the companion pieces that share the same attributes to the ones you already have. Dual-attribute relics can enhance each other, giving you more power and superior attack or offence for a time.  \\nA couple of final pointers: watch out for Dark Quartz as it taints whatever – and whoever – it touches. However, it doubles as currency so you will not be able to avoid it completely! The trees are sentient, and can sneakily snake their roots underground to trip you up and release little puffs of poison gas to boot, so keep an eye on the ground as well as in front of you!  \\nThe controls are simple: X is attack, use C to jump, special attacks use A, S, D – and if you really get stuck the witch will guide you. There is a steep and sometimes frustrating learning curve to tackle, especially at first, but once you get through the first couple of rooms, you’re away and will really begin to enjoy yourself.  Brings a New Meaning to Using Your Head\\nAs described above, Skul can use various skulls to boost power-ups and give him new powers and modes of combat. With over forty different skulls to choose, here is a selective sampling of what you can look forward to:  Mummy – unusually for mummies who are better known for curses and bandages, this one arms you with a gun and makes you impervious to traps, which is handy. Perhaps the Mummy ate Indiana Jones at some point, and acquired his weapon and some niche skills? Either way, it is a useful one to keep an eye out for! Wolf – speed and a brutal up-close clawing attack are the gifts that this beasty’s skull bestows upon you Minotaur – seismic powers are yours wearing this skull, unleashing an attack when a horde of enemies is drawing uncomfortably close and in larger numbers than you can tackle one on one Jester – chucking knives is not most people’s idea of a good joke, but this skull lets you do precisely that, and doubles-down on the matter by then having the knives explode! Gargoyle – used to being up high and occasionally portrayed with wings, this gargoyle skull lets you fly, so you can soar over enemies and avoid a messy and protracted battle. Or just get yourself to a good place to turn the odds of winning in your own favour Rock Star – music is the food of life, so play on, especially with the helpful band that this skull materialises to help you out\\nSkul: The Hero Slayer for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price. You will receive an official key and be able to play the game in seconds. Play smart. Pay less.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/6844/pcover/6844.jpg?v=1651579491', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 935}),\n",

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley\\'s Mecha-suit, which she calls \"Mr. Riggs\", can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances.BASE BUILDING\\nYour task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission.DEFENSE\\nYour presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence.EXPLORATION\\nGalatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology.CAMPAIGN\\nTake on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet.

Unknown to humanity, an alien force has arrived in the far reaches of the icy Kuiper Belt and has begun mining a dwarf planet to prepare for an invasion. \\nWith Earth’s nations unable to unite to address the alien arrival, transnational groups of like-minded political, military, and scientific leaders develop covert channels to coordinate a response. With the aliens' motives uncertain, factions emerge, driven by hope, fear, or greed.  You will control one of these factions. The Resistance works to form an alliance of nations to mount a coordinated defenseHumanity First vows to exterminate the aliens alongside any who sympathize with themThe Servants worship the aliens and believe they will solve all the troubles of the worldThe Protectorate advocates negotiated surrender as the only means to avoid annihilationThe Academy hopes the alien arrival heralds the opportunity to form an interstellar allianceThe Initiative seeks to profit from the chaos and destructionProject Exodus plans to build a massive starship and flee the Solar System   \\nA distant anomaly, a mysterious crash site, and a spike in reported disappearances. Could this truly be humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms? As your field agents investigate sightings and your scientists race to explore new fields of research, you will slowly learn the truth behind the alien arrival.  From early sightings and UFO crash sites to rampaging alien megafauna and robotic armies, it will rapidly become clear that the other six human factions are not your sole competition. Throughout the game, illustrated events will present you with difficult choices as you investigate growing alien activity on Earth. Uncover the mystery of the aliens’ origins and motives – unless, of course, you are Humanity First, and all that matters to you is extermination.Terra Invicta has a global research system that creates opportunities for both competition and cooperation. Shared scientific advancement unlocks private engineering projects. Factions can choose to focus on private projects, at the cost of weakening Earth as a whole and ceding influence over global research direction to other factions with different priorities. Left unchecked, factions like the Servants or the Initiative may steer the world’s efforts toward developing methods of social control, rather than propulsion or weapon systems.   \\nYou begin on Earth as the head of a shadowy organization devoted to your chosen ideology. The aliens are coming – soon – but your first enemies (and perhaps allies) will be other human factions.  Lead a faction united by ideology, rather than a nation defined by territory. This is a stark change from most strategy games – in Terra Invicta, you will not paint the map with the colors of some chosen nation. Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership. Geopolitics is your sandbox – unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earth’s regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities.Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space). The starting abilities of these councilors will improve through gaining experience and acquiring control over powerful organizations like intelligence agencies or wealthy corporations. A veteran commander may make the perfect choice to lead a tactical team under the council’s direction, while an experienced diplomat works to secure the funding needed to resist the alien invasion.Seek out like-minded populations and politicians and take actions to convert followers of opposing ideologies. Public opinion is modeled along multiple axes – the Servants’ alien worship and the Protectorate’s advocacy of negotiated surrender may largely align in terms of support or opposition to the aliens, but events that show the aliens can be defeated have the potential to convince followers of the Protectorate that resistance is a realistic choice.    \\nTerra Invicta bridges the gap between our modern-day world and the vast interstellar empires of other space strategy games, asking you to take humanity’s first steps in colonizing our Solar System, where over 300 asteroids, moons, and planets in constant motion create an ever-changing strategic map.  Take your faction beyond the confines of Earth, building space stations to act as shipyards and fuel depots, constructing mining stations to acquire advanced resources, and establishing bases to serve as research or construction facilities. Terra Invicta zooms into the strategic geography of the Solar System, presenting space not as a series of isolated stars that you order units to move to and from, but rather a rich and varied landscape of asteroids, moons, dwarf planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies creating texture and tactical opportunities at every turn.The expansive map is constantly shifting as celestial bodies orbit the Sun. This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.   \\nTerra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals – and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason.  Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, you’ll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earth’s gravity, but over time you’ll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply.Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage. \\nTerra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background. We hope that the Solar System setting and geopolitics simulation will provide a useful framework for modders to realize their own creative visions.\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/12187/pcover/12187.jpg?v=1697013928\", metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 950}),\n",

Various layers are added at certain points which makes the relatively slow pace of expansion a blessing, giving players time to think through their best options for going forward.  About the Game\\nUnlike many similar games, this game does not rely on blitz attacks or building huge military forces in order to succeed. You can prioritise fighting and weaponry if you want to, but the basic premise of the game is more gritty and primitive than that. \\nThere is a strong emphasis on survival, with resource growth and management being by far the most important factor in the game, trumping everything else. The land is harsh and unforgiving and will do everything in its power to overthrow the puny humans trying to eke out a living from its bounty. \\nYou can play as the Clan of the Bear who thrive in winter, lording it over the other tribes who struggle in winter when food resources become more scarce and expensive to produce, and the weather gets cold and icy. This happens every nine months or so (game months come around quicker than real life months) and can be the undoing of your small community.  Seasonal Delights\\nAlong with food shortages, winter ensures that other resources dwindle: firewood becomes harder to find, and any standing army incurs a terrible drain on resources. It is at this time that clans can become so stretched for resources that starvation can set in. \\nAs far this was not enough to deal with, special events occur at any time. These can include deadly blizzards, rat plagues and other similarly devastating occasions that can tip the balance of even a marginally healthy society towards trouble and decimation. \\nThe one advantage of the seasonal changes and even the special events is that they are programmed in, and you can see them coming on the calendar. In theory, this gives you time to plan ahead and lay in supplies or build rat-proof buildings in an effort to avoid the worst effects: but in practise it can sometimes simply make you panic as you freeze and watch your doom approaching!  Ways to Play\\nMultiplayer is the clear winner in this game, offering multiple opportunities for you to plan your civilisation and build your society from scratch. This is a broadly sandbox format that works very well for players who love to do their own thing. The random actions of the other players add a level of interest and engagement to the game that is hard to tear yourself away from. \\nThere is a single-player campaign too, in which the player can follow the story arc of one man’s quest to avenge the death of his father, working to keep his community thriving as he unravels the answers to his mission.  Occupation, occupation, occupation \\nYour population is made up of people with different jobs: each has certain needs and brings certain benefits to the community. Here is a rundown of these:   Food workers: without these workers, the rest of the population will starve to death Lumberjacks: these useful soul cut wood and supply firewood so your population can cook and – most importantly – heat their houses, particularly important during winter time Miners: the mines are used to produce stone which is the primary building material of the community. Without this, people cannot build houses and they risk freezing to death in short order. It is also needed in order to expand the community Army: armies are always useful for defeating rivals and taking all their goods. However, armies are an enormous drain on the resources chewing through money and manpower, even during summer. Armies are best used by creating them for clearance purposes and then almost immediately repurposing them as miners, lumberjacks or fishermen\\nNorthgard for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.

Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory? \\nThe game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer.

              " Document(page_content=\": 979\\nname: Xenonauts 2\\ndescription: Xenonauts 2 is a strategy game that puts you in charge of a multinational military organization tasked with eliminating an extraterrestrial threat. Working from the shadows, you must seek out and engage the growing alien presence wherever it appears. Expand and manage a covert network of bases across the globe. Pursue research and development to bridge the technological gap with the alien invaders. Train, arm, and command your ground troops wherever the alien threat emerges.  \\nIt is 2009 - the Cold War continues, and the Berlin Wall still stands. In the shadows, a secret organization works beyond arbitrary political boundaries to gather information about a greater threat to humanity. Mysterious sightings of unidentified flying objects and unknown beings have grown more common, coinciding with escalating international tensions and panic. Those who report such sightings frequently disappear without a trace, and it is clear that the aliens grow bolder with each passing day. Time is of the essence.    \\nKnowledge is power - unfortunately, little is known about the alien menace when you take charge. You will need to engage in combat operations around the globe to learn what you're up against. Eliminate extraterrestrial forces in deadly tactical battles to recover research samples, allowing your scientists to improve your equipment and slowly uncover the truth about the alien invasion.  A massive variety of enemy types will keep you on your toes as you fight against a multitude of species, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and fighting styles. Securing alien bodies to perform autopsies on will give you insights into their potential weaknesses, allowing you to prepare accordingly. Aliens aren't all you'll be fighting - human agents known as Cleaners work in tandem with the extraterrestrial threat, bringing with them added varieties of troops, combat locations, and mission objectives. The Cleaners work to further alien goals and objectives, operating directly under their influence - any strike against the Cleaners is an indirect strike against their alien overlords. You will have the opportunity to gather intel by infiltrating their bases, securing data, and seeing how far the conspiracy goes.Every combat engagement is an opportunity to learn more about the enemy force and how it fights - if you're willing to take the risk. Will you look to quickly eliminate active threats using explosives, grenades, and missiles, or will you take a more tempered approach to secure bodies and alien technology that can be taken back to HQ for autopsies and reverse-engineering? Will you focus on the development of airpower to bring down UFOs and investigate their crash sites for additional intel? Your adversary has the advantage in both technology and equipment – any choice you make will involve tradeoffs.   \\nThe war against the alien force takes on a global scale - as they attack indiscriminately, your troops must be prepared to operate across the globe using multiple bases, taking time between operations to rest, recuperate, rearm, research, and eventually reengage the enemy. No two campaigns are the same as complex simulations ensure even the smallest variances in decisions will have far-reaching impacts across the entire game.  A small radar station in Alaska detects an anomaly over the Bering Strait. Air Bases in Kamchatka and Yukon scramble jets to investigate, chasing multiple bogeys each, bringing them down over the water. Thousands of miles away, a radar station in Italy works in tandem with response teams stationed at a base in Algeria and an air base in France to take down alien operations on the Iberian Peninsula. Meanwhile, a new base is being built in Southeast Asia where the invaders have slipped through the cracks multiple times, inciting panic. Build, design, and manage multiple bases, each with its own squadrons of fighter jets and transports, radar arrays, research teams, operatives, and more. Consider the limitations of fuel ranges when you place them and use a grid-based construction system to optimally lay each of your bases out. Specialize your bases for detection, rapid response teams, research, manufacturing, and defenses as you see fit.Pursue multiple avenues of research to acquire a vast variety of aircraft, vehicles, weapons, armor, and other battlefield equipment to experiment with. Your approach on the battlefield will be determined by a combination of the terrain you're engaging in and what equipment you've chosen to bring to the field. The presence of mechanized combat platforms and vehicles can tilt many situations in your favor as they break through cover and deliver particularly devastating ordnance, though their use can come at the cost of the ability to procure valuable resources from intact alien bodies and equipment. The research tree is vast, with over one hundred projects to unlock, allowing you to take on the alien threat with your own personal strategic and tactical touches.Infuse alien technology across all manner of equipment, and even develop autonomous battlefield combat platforms and sentry guns to assist with your forward operations as well as the defense of your bases. If you give your engineering teams enough time, money, and resources, you'll find yourself well equipped for the threat - unfortunately, all three are perpetually scarce. Will you rush to produce automated combat platforms to minimize the threat to your operatives? Or produce additional dropships to respond to more threats at a time? Or will you seek improved armaments for your fighters to strengthen their ability to intercept and take down alien squadrons?Training centers you build at your bases allow soldiers to improve their combat capabilities during downtime, but actual combat experience is of course of unparalleled value. Each mission gives your operatives an opportunity to improve their abilities according to the actual actions they take in combat, and even earn medals for their deeds.   \\nWhether fighting in the air or on the ground, your tactical prowess is put to the test when engaging alien attackers. Battles are extremely dangerous affairs, asking you to manage positioning, ammunition, lines of sight, cover, and much more besides - many of your operatives will get wounded, and many of them will die, but those that survive grow more experienced and are more capable of taking on future dangers.  Scramble jets to respond to UFO sightings, engaging them in real-time tactical battles that put you in command of your fighter wings. Tell your pilots how to maneuver and who to target, ensuring their victory while also keeping an eye on their fuel gauge and the proximity of your nearby hangars. No forced 1-1 duels here – if the aliens bring a technologically advanced and heavily armed space craft to the fight, gang up and send a whole squadron of your best planes to bring it down. The strategic layer and air battles are closely intertwined, and careful planning of your global network of bases is of the utmost importance.Put boots on the ground by sending in your operatives for a variety of mission types, pursuing a range of objectives, but beware – your adversaries will not passively wait for you to discover them. Aliens will actively maneuver and seek you out from across the map, moving intelligently to strike at you from beyond visual range, hiding behind cover and taking advantage of the high ground. Maximize your chance of success through effective reconnaissance and lay ambush to eliminate the enemy.The battlefield is a dangerous place, and with an alien threat that will not stand idly by as you try to hunt them down, losses are inevitable. This isn’t the story of an elite squad of heroes winning battle after battle without loss – war is hell, and many of your troops will give their lives to resist the alien invasion. Your veteran troops will be invaluable, but even your basic recruits are skilled soldiers ready for combat. It is up to you to enable them to become the veterans of tomorrow.  \\nXenonauts 2 is a standalone title that does not need any experience playing the original Xenonauts to follow the story or enjoy the gameplay experience.

              " Document(page_content=': 982\\nname: Jurassic World Evolution 2\\ndescription: Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a business management simulation game and also a ‘disaster management game’ according to the creators. And understandably so, given the whole risky premise of the franchise! This game is the sequel to Jurassic World Evolution and a follow-on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  About the Game\\nSet in the neo-Jurassic age, you are tasked with constructing a Jurassic Park-themed ground. It must be complete with retail outlets, rides and up to 75 prehistoric species from pterosaurs to ancient marine creatures to outright dinosaurs. The animals will all need enclosures, aviaries and/ or lagoons which must be kitted out with the right types of flora and fauna to keep them happily and safely ensconced in their tailor-made enclosures. \\nMany of the animals are also highly territorial and will fight for resources if they are allowed to become hungry or needful of anything. They will stake out self-claimed territories within shared pens and these borders can shift depending on their needs and the conditions inside the pens so you will need to be watchful. The AI controlling the prehistoric creatures now has more in-depth detail, allowing the animals to work co-operatively, move in herds and so on. \\nAs well as the animals, you must devote time and resources to research and experimentation to make sure customers want to visit. This means building laboratories and recruiting scientists to keep the animals new and interesting. Do keep your workers sweet too: if they become disgruntled, overworked or underpaid, they’ll sabotage your park, release the animals and generally make themselves a bit of a nuisance in a way familiar to Jeff Goldblum… \\nYou will also need to recruit rangers and vets to look after the animals, as well as building exciting and inviting rides to keep the customers happy. \\nIn this game, you have a choice of biomes: forest, deserts and more, which gives you both more of a challenge and more opportunities than the original game which offered one landscape type only.   The Nitty Gritty\\nIn order to recreate a species, you must extract the DNA and then incubate the resulting creature. You can ‘edit’ the DNA, imparting disease resistance and other unique traits – but do be careful not to make a super-beast that might become too smart and strong for your control! \\nThe whole game requires a delicate balance of intrigue and safety. Achieving and then maintaining that balance is an absorbing and immersive experience. Bear in mind, always: when it seems to be going well it is time to be extra wary! You are surfing on the very edge of the catastrophe curve and it does not take much at all to make it all come tumbling down about your ears! \\nUniquely in this game, you are not confined to the park, you can explore the surrounding landscape, giving the game a nicely sandbox vibe for those mindful moments when you need to escape from annoying scientists and annoyed customers! \\nYour daily activities will include hunting down wild dinosaurs, tracking them using their tracks, poop and damage caused until you find and neutralise the threat – or it escapes and you have to try and relocate it as soon as you possibly can! If it goes well, you whistle up your helicopter, sedate the creature and take it back to your park, where you begin to look after it. But don’t expect gratitude from these rescues – they would much rather eat you!  Ways to Play\\nThere are four ways to play the game, namely:  Campaign Mode – continues the story arc from Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and has you rounding up some of the now genuinely wild dinosaurs as well as completing other tasks too Chaos Theory Mode – revisits the key moments of the franchise giving you the chance to see how things would play out differently if different choices were made Challenge Mode – gives you a series of challenges to complete as fast as you can Sandbox Mode – explore your surroundings, do some research and try out new and exciting rides that you have just built. Typical sandbox fun \\nJurassic World Evolution 2 takes you back to the tropical islands where men played God – and very nearly won!\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9005/pcover/9005.jpg?v=1705328863', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 982}),\n",

The old ways are gone – ground into dust by the powerful Maelstrom – and rising from the ashes are six powerful factions, vying for control over the ravaged landscape under the Dome. Will they be allies or enemies? That choice – and the future of the Dome – is in your hands.    \\nNot everyone under the Dome is your friend; quite the reverse in fact. If you’re a smart likeable character (with a high charisma rating) you might be able to talk your way out of things. But more likely it’s time for a bit of ultra-violence. And that means weapons; lots of weapons. And there’s no shortage of choice: from high tech beam weapons through to a solid right hook, there’s loads of way to bring down a hostile group of foes. Of course, you can be a pacifist and use non-lethal force but that’s a story for another day…   \\nThe hostile and unforgiving world can be a lonely place; so why not team up with some like-minded individuals and face the challenges together. From hardened criminals built like mountains or scientists with a shady past, there’s a host of different potential companions to journey with, each replete with their own unique personality and skills.  \\nOr you can just go “Lone Wolf” and face everything alone; it’s not an easy road but you can play this way too if you so wish.   \\nEncased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join and how honourable a person you are. What equipment do you take? How will you fight? Do you craft better weapons or armour?  \\nAnd it doesn’t stop there. You will hold lives in the balance and will have to choose who survives and who perishes.  \\nAnd every decision you make will impact the story and your gaming experience. Well, no one said surviving Armageddon was going to be easy…\\nimg_url: https://gaming-cdn.com/img/products/9001/pcover/9001.jpg?v=1705491521', metadata={'source': '/content/gaming_content.csv', 'row': 983}),\n",

The latest models can make even the highest peaks accessible in no time. \\nPlan, build and improve until you’ve created your dream ski area.

With 12 different skier profiles in the game, some are more interested in a good raclette, while others come to commune with nature. And then there are the hardcore ski fanatics, who won’t settle for anything less than the longest run the mountain has to offer. \\nThere’s no money in Snowtopia. Make your skiers happy enough and they might join the team of volunteers running the resort. Divide your workforce between the lift operators, maintenance crew, service facilities, and resort improvement team. \\nGrowing the reputation of your resort leads to more skiers on the slopes. But beware - more skiers means more accidents! Make sure you have enough snow groomers and ski patrols to keep the slopes safe at all times. \\nRemember, no one likes a broken chairlift, but everyone loves sunbathing on the terrace!

Instead, you can hop into your spaceship and travel to any of the unlocked areas in the map – these will obviously widen the more you play – and continue with your mission in that area until you, perhaps, find yourself struggling. \\nThen it is a simple matter to jump back into your ship, and pop off to another planet or a different area to power up and build the skills you are currently lacking while you solve easier (or perhaps just differently arranged) missions before heading back to try again when it suits you. So, a sort of open-linear-hybrid world that offers some freedom and some direction to the players.  Advice for New Players Keep an eye on progress of skill trees – some areas of the game need you to have a certain skill before you can move on Look for secondary and secret ways to progress around obstacles before committing to going through them. Sometimes you can sneak into caves or find hidden pathways that will lead you safely past a group of storm-troopers or other enemies Some areas have ‘soft spots’ where Cal can tap into the force and receive Jedi wisdom. These spot are called Force Echoes, and they are always worth finding Combat is less a matter of repeated urgent button presses and more a case for finesse, timing and precision. Make sure you master all your weaponry properly, charging out yelling and trying to bludgeon your way through the enemy is a certain way to sudden death Cal is accompanied by his trusty companion, a droid called BD-1 (Buddy #1, perhaps?) who follows Cal, warns him of danger and provides healing packs whenever they are needed. He chunters around, providing running commentary, uncovering secret entries and generally providing Cal with someone to talk to\\nAbove all, bear one thing in mind: this is the Star Wars Game you’ve been looking for! \\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order for PC is available for purchase on Instant Gaming for a fraction of its retail price.
